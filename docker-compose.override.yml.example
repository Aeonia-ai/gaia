# Example Docker Compose Override for Local Development
# 
# To use this file:
# 1. Copy this file to docker-compose.override.yml:
#    cp docker-compose.override.yml.example docker-compose.override.yml
# 2. Run: docker-compose up (the override loads automatically)
# 
# NOTE: The relative path assumes you follow the standard directory structure.
#       If your KB vault is elsewhere, update the path in your override file.
#
# The override file is gitignored, so your local paths won't be committed.
#
# In production/remote deployments, use: docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
# This explicitly excludes the override file.

services:
  kb-service:
    volumes:
      # Uses relative path from gaia/ directory to the KB vault
      # Assumes standard directory structure:
      # Development/Aeonia/Server/gaia/ (this repo)
      # Development/Aeonia/Vaults/gaia-knowledge-base/ (KB vault)
      - ../../Vaults/gaia-knowledge-base:/kb:rw
      
    environment:
      # Development mode flag
      KB_DEV_MODE: "true"
      
  # You can override other services for local development too
  # Example: Use a local Redis instance instead of the container
  # redis:
  #   image: redis:7-alpine
  #   ports:
  #     - "6379:6379"
