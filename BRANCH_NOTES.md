# Branch: feat/auth-spa-improvements

## Summary
This branch adds authentication protection and SPA-like navigation to the web UI.

## Changes Made

### 1. Authentication Protection (Commit: 9fa98fb)
- Added JWT/session checks to all chat routes
- Protected endpoints: `/chat`, `/chat/{id}`, `/api/chat/send`, etc.
- Unauthenticated users redirect to `/login`
- HTMX requests get client-side redirects

### 2. SPA Navigation (Commit: e0a4ca5)
- Partial page updates via HTMX
- Only main content swaps on navigation
- Smooth fade transitions between views
- Browser URL updates without reload
- Active conversation highlighting
- Global HTMX configuration for SPA behavior

### 3. Testing Infrastructure (Commit: f4198bd)
- Automated test scripts for SPA features
- Support for .env test credentials
- Manual testing guide
- HTMX navigation validation

## Ready to Merge
This branch is ready to merge once the auth migration branch is integrated.
The SPA improvements are independent of the auth backend implementation.

## Testing
After auth is working:
```bash
# Add to .env:
TEST_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
TEST_PASSWORD=your-password

# Run tests:
./scripts/test-spa-auth.sh
```

## Next Steps
1. Merge auth migration branch
2. Test full SPA experience with working auth
3. Enhance chat window for new features
4. Extend sidebar functionality
