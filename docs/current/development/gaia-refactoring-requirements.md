# Gaia Platform Refactoring Requirements

## Executive Summary

This document outlines requirements for refactoring the Gaia platform based on architectural lessons learned from Eureka. The goal is to maintain Gaia's powerful microservices capabilities while dramatically improving developer experience, operational simplicity, and user-perceived performance.

**Core Principle**: Make complexity invisible to users and developers while preserving the flexibility needed for real-time, multi-tenant gaming applications.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Unified API Gateway Layer

#### 1.1 Resource-Oriented Endpoints
- **Requirement**: Gateway must present cohesive, resource-oriented APIs that hide internal service complexity
- **Example**: 
  ```
  POST /ai/generate
  {
    "type": "image|audio|text|3d",
    "prompt": "...",
    "options": {}
  }
  ```
  Routes internally to Asset, Chat, or KB services as needed

#### 1.2 Transparent Service Orchestration
- **Requirement**: Gateway handles multi-service workflows without client awareness
- **Example**: Generating an AI response that needs KB context + chat completion
- **Success Criteria**: Single request/response from client perspective

#### 1.3 Backward Compatibility
- **Requirement**: All existing client endpoints must continue working unchanged
- **Migration Path**: New unified endpoints alongside legacy routes

### 2. Progressive Complexity Deployment

#### 2.1 Deployment Profiles
- **Requirement**: Support multiple deployment configurations
  ```yaml
  # Profiles:
  - simple:   Gateway + Unified Backend (2 containers)
  - standard: Gateway + Core Services (4 containers)  
  - full:     All services + NATS + Monitoring (8+ containers)
  ```

#### 2.2 Service Consolidation Options
- **Requirement**: Services can run standalone OR consolidated
- **Implementation**: Environment variable `SERVICE_MODE=standalone|consolidated`
- **Example**: Auth + Chat + KB can run in single process for simple deployments

### 3. Developer Experience

#### 3.1 Single Command Development
- **Requirement**: Developers can start any configuration with one command
  ```bash
  gaia dev chat        # Just chat service + dependencies
  gaia dev --simple    # Minimal 2-service setup
  gaia dev --full      # Complete microservices
  ```

#### 3.2 Intelligent CLI Tooling
- **Requirement**: CLI that understands service topology
  ```bash
  gaia logs --request-id=xyz     # Shows logs across all services
  gaia test user-journey         # Tests complete workflows
  gaia debug --service=chat      # Attaches debugger
  ```

#### 3.3 Auto-Generated SDKs
- **Requirement**: Client SDKs generated from OpenAPI specs
- **Languages**: Python, TypeScript, C# (Unity), C++ (Unreal)
- **Feature**: SDKs hide service complexity entirely

### 4. Operational Excellence

#### 4.1 Graceful Degradation
- **Requirement**: System remains functional when individual services fail
- **Implementation**:
  - Circuit breakers with intelligent defaults
  - Fallback responses for non-critical services
  - Health-aware load balancing

#### 4.2 Unified Observability
- **Requirement**: Single pane of glass for system monitoring
- **Features**:
  - Correlation IDs across all services
  - Business metrics (not just technical)
  - Request journey visualization

#### 4.3 Smart Caching Architecture
- **Requirement**: Performance optimization without complexity
- **Implementation**:
  - Shared Redis cache with standardized keys
  - Cache warming for predictable workloads
  - Edge caching in gateway

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Performance

#### 1.1 Response Time SLAs
- Chat responses: < 100ms (first token)
- Asset generation initiation: < 200ms
- KB search: < 50ms
- Authentication: < 30ms (cached)

#### 1.2 Scalability Targets
- Support 10,000 concurrent users
- 1M requests/day
- Horizontal scaling per service
- Auto-scaling based on workload

### 2. Security

#### 2.1 Progressive Security Modes
- **Simple**: API key only (development)
- **Standard**: JWT + API key
- **Full**: mTLS + JWT + API key (production)

#### 2.2 Zero Trust Architecture
- Service-to-service authentication required
- Encrypted communication by default
- Audit logging for all operations

### 3. Reliability

#### 3.1 Availability Targets
- 99.9% uptime for core services
- No single point of failure
- Automated failover
- Data consistency guarantees

#### 3.2 Deployment Safety
- Blue-green deployments per service
- Automated rollback on failure
- Database migration compatibility
- Feature flags for gradual rollout

### 4. Maintainability

#### 4.1 Code Organization
- Shared libraries for common patterns
- Standardized service template
- Consistent error handling
- Comprehensive test coverage

#### 4.2 Documentation Standards
- OpenAPI spec for every endpoint
- Architecture decision records
- Runbooks for common operations
- Onboarding guide < 30 minutes

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
1. Create unified gateway API design
2. Implement service consolidation framework
3. Build CLI tooling MVP
4. Set up unified logging pipeline

### Phase 2: Developer Experience (Weeks 5-8)
1. Create deployment profiles
2. Build auto-generated SDKs
3. Implement correlation ID system
4. Create developer documentation

### Phase 3: Operational Excellence (Weeks 9-12)
1. Implement graceful degradation
2. Build monitoring dashboard
3. Add smart caching layer
4. Create performance benchmarks

### Phase 4: Migration (Weeks 13-16)
1. Migrate existing clients to unified APIs
2. Deprecate redundant endpoints
3. Optimize service boundaries
4. Production deployment

## Success Metrics

### Developer Satisfaction
- Time to first successful API call: < 10 minutes
- Time to understand architecture: < 1 hour
- Developer NPS score: > 50

### Operational Efficiency
- Deployment time: < 5 minutes
- Mean time to recovery: < 15 minutes
- Infrastructure cost: 30% reduction

### System Performance
- P95 latency: Meet all SLAs
- Error rate: < 0.1%
- Cache hit rate: > 80%

## Migration Strategy

### Principles
1. No breaking changes to existing clients
2. Incremental migration path
3. Ability to rollback at any stage
4. Clear communication with stakeholders

### Approach
1. **Parallel Run**: New architecture alongside existing
2. **Gradual Migration**: Move services one at a time
3. **Client Migration**: Update SDKs with fallback
4. **Deprecation**: Remove old code after validation

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Service consolidation breaks isolation
- **Mitigation**: Careful module boundaries, extensive testing

### Operational Risks
- **Risk**: Increased gateway complexity
- **Mitigation**: Circuit breakers, comprehensive monitoring

### Business Risks
- **Risk**: Migration disrupts existing clients
- **Mitigation**: Backward compatibility, phased rollout

## Conclusion

This refactoring will transform Gaia from a complex microservices platform into an elegantly simple yet powerful system. By learning from Eureka's simplicity while preserving Gaia's capabilities, we can deliver the best of both worlds: a platform that's easy to use, simple to operate, and capable of handling demanding real-time gaming workloads.
