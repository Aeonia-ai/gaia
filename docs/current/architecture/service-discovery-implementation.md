# Service Discovery Implementation

## Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive service discovery system to solve the microservices communication challenge. This document captures the implementation details and how to use it.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Core Service Discovery Module

**File**: `app/shared/service_discovery.py`

Key components:
- `ServiceRegistry`: Central registry managing all service information
- `create_service_health_endpoint()`: Helper to create enhanced health endpoints
- `discover_services_from_config()`: Discovers services based on configuration
- Automatic health checking every 30 seconds

### 2. Enhanced Health Endpoints

All services now expose their routes via enhanced health endpoints:

```bash
# Regular health check
GET /health
Response: {"service": "chat", "status": "healthy", "version": "0.2"}

# Health check with routes
GET /health?include_routes=true
Response: {
  "service": "chat",
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "0.2",
  "routes": [
    {"path": "/chat/intelligent", "methods": ["POST"], "description": "Intelligent routing"},
    {"path": "/chat/fast", "methods": ["POST"], "description": "Fast chat"},
    {"path": "/chat/mcp-agent", "methods": ["POST"], "description": "MCP agent chat"}
  ]
}
```

### 3. Services Updated

- **Chat Service**: `app/services/chat/main.py`
- **Auth Service**: `app/services/auth/main.py`
- **KB Service**: `app/services/kb/main.py`
- **Asset Service**: `app/services/asset/main.py`

All now use: `create_service_health_endpoint(app, service_name, version)`

### 4. Gateway Integration

**File**: `app/gateway/main.py`

New features:
- Service discovery on startup
- Dynamic route checking
- New endpoints demonstrating discovery:
  - `/chat/intelligent`
  - `/chat/fast`
  - `/chat/mcp-agent`
  - `/chat/intelligent/metrics`

## Usage Guide

### For Service Developers

1. **Replace standard health endpoint**:
```python
# Old way
@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy"}

# New way
from app.shared.service_discovery import create_service_health_endpoint
create_service_health_endpoint(app, "my-service", "1.0")
```

2. **Add endpoints normally** - they're automatically discovered!

### For Gateway Developers

1. **Check if route exists**:
```python
from app.shared.service_discovery import service_registry

# Get routes for a service
routes = service_registry.get_service_routes("chat")

# Check if specific route exists
for route in routes:
    if route.path == "/my/endpoint" and "POST" in route.methods:
        # Route exists, forward request
```

2. **Get all healthy services**:
```python
healthy_services = service_registry.get_healthy_services()
for name, info in healthy_services.items():
    print(f"{name}: {len(info.routes)} routes available")
```

## Testing

Run the test script:
```bash
./scripts/test-service-discovery.sh
```

This tests:
- Enhanced health endpoints for all services
- Gateway's discovered services
- New dynamic endpoints
- Proper 404 handling

## Benefits Realized

1. **No more hardcoded routes** - Services register automatically
2. **Independent deployment** - Services can evolve without gateway changes
3. **Better debugging** - Clear visibility into available endpoints
4. **Automatic updates** - New endpoints available immediately

## Next Steps with Chat Service

Now that we have service discovery, we can:
1. Add new chat endpoints without touching the gateway
2. Create specialized routing endpoints
3. Implement the intelligent chat features we discussed
4. Deploy iteratively without coordination overhead

The foundation is set for rapid development!
