# Admin Credential Security Recommendations

## Current Security Issues

As of August 2025, the GAIA platform has the following credential security vulnerabilities:

1. **Exposed Admin Credentials**: The `admin@aeonia.ai` account uses a known password (`TestPassword123!`) that was previously documented in the repository
2. **No Credential Rotation**: The same password has been used since project inception
3. **Shared Admin Account**: Multiple team members likely use the same admin account
4. **Test/Production Overlap**: Test documentation previously referenced production admin credentials

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Rotate Admin Password
```bash
# Use Supabase dashboard or CLI to update admin@aeonia.ai password
# Generate a strong password (minimum 16 characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
# Example: Use a password manager to generate something like: "Gk9#mP2$vN8!qR5&"
```

### 2. Create Role-Based Admin Accounts
Instead of sharing `admin@aeonia.ai`, create individual admin accounts:
- `jason-admin@aeonia.ai` - For Jason (founder)
- `dev-admin@aeonia.ai` - For development team
- `ops-admin@aeonia.ai` - For operations team

### 3. Environment-Specific Accounts
Create separate admin accounts for each environment:
- `admin@dev.aeonia.ai` - Development environment
- `admin@staging.aeonia.ai` - Staging environment
- `admin@prod.aeonia.ai` - Production environment

## Best Practices Going Forward

### 1. Credential Storage
- **NEVER** commit passwords to the repository
- Use environment variables for all credentials
- Store production credentials in a secure password manager
- Use different passwords for each environment

### 2. Test User Management
- Test users should use a separate domain (e.g., `@test.local`)
- Test passwords should be clearly non-production (e.g., `test-only-password-123`)
- Document test accounts separately from production accounts

### 3. Access Control
- Implement proper RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- Use Supabase RLS (Row Level Security) policies
- Audit admin access quarterly
- Remove access promptly when team members leave

### 4. Monitoring
- Enable Supabase audit logs for admin actions
- Monitor failed login attempts
- Set up alerts for unusual admin activity
- Review access logs monthly

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Change `admin@aeonia.ai` password immediately
- [ ] Create individual admin accounts for team members
- [ ] Update all services to use new credentials via environment variables
- [ ] Remove any remaining hardcoded credentials from codebase
- [ ] Set up credential rotation schedule (every 90 days)
- [ ] Document new credential management process
- [ ] Train team on security best practices
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerting
