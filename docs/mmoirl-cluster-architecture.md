# MMOIRL Cluster-Per-Game Architecture

## ðŸ§  KOS: The Living Proof of MMOIRL Principles

**We're not just proposing MMOIRL - we've been living it since June 2024 through our Knowledge Operating System (KOS).**

### KOS as MMOIRL Implementation
The Knowledge Operating System demonstrates every MMOIRL principle in daily use:

- **Persistent Memory**: KB stores all contexts, dreams, insights across sessions (like game save states)
- **Context Switching**: "Load consciousness context" = changing game realms/zones
- **Thread Tracking**: Active quests/missions across different knowledge domains
- **Daily Creation Cycle**: Gamified workflow following natural energy patterns
- **Cross-Domain Synthesis**: Bridging insights between contexts (collecting items across zones)
- **AI Companions**: Meta-Mind, Mu, Bestie = different companion personalities for different needs

### From Text to Spatial
KOS proves these consciousness technology patterns work:
```
Text-Based (Current):        â†’  Spatial VR/AR (Future):
KB Context Loading           â†’  Game World Loading
Thread Management            â†’  Quest/Mission Tracking
Insight Synthesis            â†’  Item/Power Collection
AI Companions               â†’  NPC Personalities
Persistent Memory           â†’  Character Progression
```

This isn't theoretical - it's **months of proven daily usage** showing how consciousness technology enhances human capability.

## Recommended Approach: Start Simple, Ship Fast

**Decision: Use cluster-per-game architecture to launch MMOIRL games quickly.**

Instead of spending 3-4 months building multi-tenancy, deploy a dedicated Gaia cluster for each game. This gets your first game live in 2-3 weeks and provides complete isolation and customization capabilities.

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. Complete Isolation
- **Data Security**: No risk of cross-game data leakage
- **Performance**: One game can't impact another's performance
- **Failures**: Issues in one game don't affect others
- **Compliance**: Each game can meet different regulatory requirements

### 2. Customization Freedom
- **Tech Stack**: Each game can use different versions or even different services
- **MCP Tools**: Game-specific MCP servers without conflicts
- **Personas**: Custom AI personalities per game
- **APIs**: Different external service integrations

### 3. Simplified Development
- **No Tenant Logic**: Code remains simple without tenant checks
- **Direct Access**: No need to filter by tenant in queries
- **Clear Boundaries**: Developers work on isolated codebases
- **Easy Testing**: Test environments mirror production exactly

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Templates (Week 1-2)
```yaml
# kubernetes/templates/gaia-game-cluster.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: gaia-{{GAME_ID}}
---
# All Gaia services templated for easy deployment
```

### Phase 2: Deployment Automation (Week 2-3)
```bash
# scripts/deploy-game-cluster.sh
#!/bin/bash
GAME_ID=$1
GAME_CONFIG=$2

# Deploy infrastructure
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/templates/gaia-game-cluster.yaml | sed "s/{{GAME_ID}}/$GAME_ID/g"

# Configure game-specific settings
kubectl create secret generic game-config \
  --from-file=$GAME_CONFIG \
  --namespace=gaia-$GAME_ID
```

### Phase 3: Management Platform (Week 3-4)
- Central dashboard to manage all game clusters
- Automated provisioning for new games
- Cross-cluster monitoring and alerts
- Billing aggregation

## Cluster Configuration Per Game

### Base Services (All Games)
```yaml
services:
  - gateway       # API entry point
  - auth          # Player authentication
  - chat          # AI interactions
  - nats          # Message broker
  - redis         # Cache & state
  - postgres      # Persistent data
```

### Game-Specific Customizations
```yaml
# games/zombie-survival/config.yaml
name: "Zombie Survival MMOIRL"
theme: "post-apocalyptic"
services:
  chat:
    personas:
      - survivor_guide
      - zombie_expert
      - medical_advisor
    mcp_servers:
      - weather_api      # Real weather affects gameplay
      - location_service # GPS-based encounters
      - news_scraper     # World events influence game
  
# games/fantasy-quest/config.yaml  
name: "Fantasy Quest AR"
theme: "medieval fantasy"
services:
  chat:
    personas:
      - wise_wizard
      - quest_giver
      - merchant
    mcp_servers:
      - image_recognition  # Identify real objects as game items
      - social_media      # Share achievements
      - payment_gateway   # In-game purchases
```

## Resource Scaling

### Small Game (< 1k concurrent players)
```yaml
replicas:
  gateway: 2
  chat: 2
  redis: 1 (single instance)
resources:
  chat:
    memory: 1Gi
    cpu: 500m
```

### Medium Game (1k-10k concurrent)
```yaml
replicas:
  gateway: 5
  chat: 10
  redis: 3 (cluster mode)
resources:
  chat:
    memory: 2Gi
    cpu: 1000m
```

### Large Game (10k+ concurrent)
```yaml
replicas:
  gateway: 10+
  chat: 20+
  redis: 5+ (cluster mode)
resources:
  chat:
    memory: 4Gi
    cpu: 2000m
```

## Cost Optimization

### Shared Infrastructure
While each game gets its own cluster, some resources can be shared:
- **Container Registry**: Single registry for all images
- **Monitoring Stack**: Centralized Prometheus/Grafana
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Shared build infrastructure
- **Backup Storage**: Consolidated S3 buckets

### Auto-Scaling
```yaml
# Enable aggressive auto-scaling per game
horizontalPodAutoscaler:
  minReplicas: 1  # Scale to zero during off-hours
  maxReplicas: 50
  targetCPUUtilization: 70%
```

## Migration Path

### Starting Simple
1. Begin with Docker Compose per game
2. Use Fly.io apps with naming convention: `gaia-{game-id}-{service}`
3. Migrate to Kubernetes as games grow

### Example Fly.io Deployment
```bash
# Deploy zombie-survival game
fly apps create gaia-zombie-gateway
fly apps create gaia-zombie-chat
fly apps create gaia-zombie-auth

# Each with its own configuration
fly secrets set -a gaia-zombie-chat \
  GAME_ID=zombie-survival \
  THEME_CONFIG=post-apocalyptic \
  MCP_SERVERS=weather,location,news
```

## Operational Considerations

### Monitoring
- **Per-Game Dashboards**: Grafana dashboard per game
- **Unified Alerts**: PagerDuty integration for all games
- **Cost Tracking**: Tag resources by game for billing

### Updates
- **Rolling Updates**: Update games independently
- **Canary Deployments**: Test updates on low-traffic games first
- **Feature Flags**: Enable features per game

### Backup & Recovery
- **Automated Backups**: Daily snapshots per game
- **Isolated Recovery**: Restore single game without affecting others
- **Compliance**: Different retention policies per game

## Example Game Configurations

### 1. Zombie Survival MMOIRL
```yaml
infrastructure:
  cluster_size: medium
  regions: [us-east, us-west, eu-west]
  
features:
  real_weather_integration: true
  location_based_events: true
  social_features: true
  
ai_configuration:
  response_time_target: 500ms  # Fast for action gameplay
  personality: "urgent, survival-focused"
  context_window: 5  # Recent messages only
```

### 2. Historical Mystery AR
```yaml
infrastructure:
  cluster_size: small
  regions: [us-east]
  
features:
  image_recognition: true
  educational_content: true
  collaborative_puzzles: true
  
ai_configuration:
  response_time_target: 2s  # Thoughtful responses OK
  personality: "mysterious, educational"
  context_window: 20  # Remember clues
```

### 3. Fitness Challenge MMOIRL
```yaml
infrastructure:
  cluster_size: large
  regions: [global]
  
features:
  health_api_integration: true
  competitive_leaderboards: true

ai_configuration:
  response_time_target: 300ms  # Ultra-fast for workouts
  personality: "motivational, energetic"
  context_window: 10
```

## Future Migration Path

### When to Consider Multi-Tenancy
- Running 50+ small games with similar requirements
- Most games have < 100 concurrent players
- Operational overhead of managing clusters becomes excessive
- Need to optimize infrastructure costs

### Migration Strategy
1. **Add tenant column** to database tables
2. **Implement tenant filtering** in queries
3. **Namespace Redis keys** by tenant
4. **Add tenant context** to authentication
5. **Run hybrid** with both architectures
6. **Gradually migrate** small games to shared clusters

See [Multi-Tenancy Migration Guide](multitenancy-migration-guide.md) for detailed steps.

### Maintaining Flexibility
- **Feature flags** to toggle between modes
- **Extract successful games** back to dedicated clusters
- **Hybrid approach**: Big games dedicated, small games shared

## Conclusion

The cluster-per-game approach provides:
- **Maximum flexibility** for game developers
- **Complete isolation** for security and performance
- **Simple codebase** without multi-tenancy complexity
- **Independent scaling** based on game popularity
- **Easy customization** of AI behaviors and integrations
- **Reversible decision** with clear migration path

This architecture scales from indie games (single Docker Compose) to massive MMOs (multi-region Kubernetes clusters) while maintaining operational simplicity and the option to consolidate when needed.
