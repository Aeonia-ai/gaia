## üéØ Quick Navigation

### For Developers
```bash
# Quick start local development
cd /path/to/gaia
docker compose up
./scripts/test.sh --local all

# Smart environment testing
./scripts/test.sh --staging health     # Test staging deployment
./scripts/test.sh --prod all           # Full production tests

# Platform management
./scripts/manage.sh status             # Environment overview
./scripts/manage.sh deploy-and-test staging

# See main development guide
cat CLAUDE.md
```

### For DevOps/SRE
```bash
# Complete deployment pipeline
cat docs/deployment-pipeline.md

# Environment-specific deployments (all use full microservices)
./scripts/deploy.sh --env dev --services all         # Dev: Full microservices
./scripts/deploy.sh --env staging --services all     # Staging: Full microservices
./scripts/deploy.sh --env production --services all  # Production: Full microservices

# Pipeline monitoring
./scripts/manage.sh status                # All environments overview
./scripts/manage.sh monitor production    # Real-time monitoring
./scripts/manage.sh rollback staging      # Emergency rollback

# Scaling documentation
cat docs/scaling-architecture.md

# Kubernetes examples included with:
# - Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)
# - Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA)  
# - Service mesh configuration
# - Monitoring & alerting
```

### For Product Teams
- **Performance**: 10x traffic handling, 400ms response times
- **Cost**: 50% reduction through intelligent scaling
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with fault isolation
- **Scale**: Independent service scaling per workload

## üìä Architecture Overview

```
Gaia Platform Microservices
‚îú‚îÄ Gateway Service (8666) - API routing & authentication
‚îú‚îÄ Auth Service - JWT validation via Supabase  
‚îú‚îÄ Chat Service - LLM interactions & streaming
‚îú‚îÄ Asset Service - Image/3D generation
‚îú‚îÄ Performance Service - Monitoring & health
‚îî‚îÄ Shared Infrastructure (PostgreSQL, NATS, Redis)
```

## üéÆ MMOIRL Support

- **Cluster-Per-Game Architecture** - Each game gets its own Gaia deployment
- **MCP-Agent Integration** - Full tool support for real-world interactions
- **Sub-500ms AI Responses** - Fast enough for real-time gameplay
- **Flexible Deployment** - Docker Compose ‚Üí Fly.io ‚Üí Kubernetes path
- **No Multi-Tenancy Complexity** - Ship games in weeks, not months

### Quick Start for MMOIRL
```bash
# Deploy your first game
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up
# Customize personas and tools in mcp_agent_remote.config.yaml
# Deploy to Fly.io: fly apps create gaia-zombies-gateway
```

## üéâ Key Achievements

- **78+ Endpoints** implemented with full LLM Platform compatibility
- **100% Backward Compatibility** - all existing clients work unchanged
- **Microservices Architecture** with independent scaling and fault isolation
- **Smart Operations** - Environment-aware testing, deployment, and management
- **Production Deployed** - Live staging environment on Fly.io with co-located database
- **Comprehensive Testing** - 80+ endpoint tests with intelligent failure handling
- **MMOIRL Ready** - MCP tools, orchestration, and cluster-per-game architecture
