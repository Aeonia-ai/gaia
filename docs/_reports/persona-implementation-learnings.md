# Persona Implementation Learnings

This document captures key learnings from debugging persona implementation in the unified chat system.

## Executive Summary

While implementing personas (AI personality profiles like "Mu" the cheerful robot), we discovered critical issues with how system messages and conversation history interact in LLM APIs, particularly with Claude/Anthropic.

## Key Discoveries

### 1. Authentication and User ID Extraction Patterns

**Problem**: Inconsistent user ID extraction across different auth patterns.

**Finding**: The system uses multiple patterns for extracting user IDs:
```python
# Different patterns found:
user_id = auth.get("sub") or auth.get("key", "unknown")  # Original
user_id = auth.get("user_id") or auth.get("sub") or auth.get("key", "unknown")  # Fixed
```

**Root Cause**: Different auth methods (JWT, API keys, gateway auth) use different field names:
- JWT auth: Uses `user_id` field
- Supabase auth: Uses `sub` (subject) field  
- API key auth: Uses `key` field

### 2. System Message Handling in Conversation History

**Problem**: Personas not being applied consistently even when loaded correctly.

**Finding**: Multiple system messages can exist in the message array:
1. The current system message with persona is added first
2. Conversation history may contain additional system messages from previous conversations
3. LLMs may give precedence to later system messages or become confused

**Evidence**:
```python
# In unified_chat.py - loads ANY role from history
for msg in messages:
    conversation_history.append({
        "role": msg["role"],  # This includes "system" roles!
        "content": msg["content"],
        "timestamp": msg.get("created_at", "")
    })
```

### 3. Tool Instructions vs Persona Identity

**Problem**: Mixing persona identity with routing/tool instructions dilutes the persona.

**Finding**: The system prompt combines:
- Persona identity (e.g., "You are Mu, a cheerful robot companion")
- Extensive routing instructions about when to use tools
- Direct response categories that explicitly mention "What's your name?"

This creates conflicting instructions where the routing logic overrides persona identity.

### 4. Anthropic API Tool Handling

**Finding**: Tools should be passed as a separate parameter, NOT in the system message.

Per Anthropic documentation:
- Tools are defined in the `tools` parameter
- System message should focus on role/personality
- Mixing tool definitions in system message is an anti-pattern

### 5. Conversation Persistence Patterns

**Current Implementation**:
- Only saves user and assistant messages
- Does NOT save system messages to conversation history
- But LOADS all messages including system from history

This asymmetry can cause issues when conversations are loaded from other sources.

## Architectural Issues Identified

### 1. Message Array Structure

**Issue**: No validation of message array structure before sending to LLM.

**Impact**: 
- Multiple system messages can exist
- System messages can appear after user/assistant messages
- No guarantee of proper message ordering

### 2. Persona + Routing Coupling

**Issue**: Persona and routing logic are tightly coupled in the same system prompt.

**Better Pattern**:
- Persona should be about identity and behavior
- Routing should be handled separately or more subtly
- Tool usage instructions should be minimal in persona prompt

### 3. Test User Management

**Issue**: Integration tests used string user IDs instead of proper UUIDs from database.

**Solution**: Use shared test user pattern with real database users:
```python
# Good pattern
user = SharedTestUser.get_or_create()  # Returns real UUID
headers = jwt_auth.create_auth_headers(user_id=user["user_id"])

# Bad pattern  
headers = jwt_auth.create_auth_headers(user_id="test-user-chat")  # String ID
```

## Recommendations

### 1. Separate Persona from Routing

Create cleaner separation:
```python
# Persona prompt (identity focused)
persona_prompt = "You are Mu, a cheerful robot companion..."

# Routing handled via tool availability, not extensive instructions
# Let the LLM naturally understand tool usage from descriptions
```

### 2. Validate Message History

Filter or validate conversation history before adding to messages:
```python
# Only include user/assistant messages from history
for msg in conversation_history:
    if msg["role"] in ["user", "assistant"]:
        messages.append(msg)
```

### 3. Store Persona Context

Consider storing persona selection as conversation metadata rather than system messages:
```python
conversation = {
    "id": "...",
    "user_id": "...",
    "persona_id": "mu",  # Store persona selection
    "messages": [...]    # Only user/assistant messages
}
```

### 4. Explicit Persona Instructions

For strong persona adherence, be more explicit:
```python
persona_prompt = """You are Mu, a cheerful robot companion.

IMPORTANT: When asked your name, always respond with "Mu" or include "Mu" in your response.
Your personality traits:
- Cheerful and optimistic
- Use expressions like "Beep boop!"
- Always maintain your identity as Mu
"""
```

### 5. Testing Best Practices

For persona testing:
- Use real database users with proper UUIDs
- Test for personality characteristics, not just name
- Consider that LLMs may interpret personas differently
- Test conversation continuity with persona

## Conclusion

The persona implementation revealed deeper architectural issues around message handling, system prompt organization, and the interaction between identity and functionality. Successful persona implementation requires careful consideration of how LLMs process system messages and clear separation of concerns between identity, behavior, and capabilities.
