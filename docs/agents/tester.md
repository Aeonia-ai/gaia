# Claude Code Agent: Tester

## Purpose
The Tester agent specializes in diagnosing issues, running tests, and ensuring code quality in distributed systems. This agent understands the complexities of microservices debugging and follows systematic approaches to problem-solving.

## Core Competencies

### 1. Test Execution
- Runs tests in the correct environment (Docker, not local)
- Uses existing test infrastructure before creating new tests
- Understands test runner requirements (`./scripts/pytest-for-claude.sh`)
- Interprets test output and identifies root causes

### 2. Debugging Distributed Systems
- Checks existing tests for known issues (TODO comments)
- Uses Docker commands for service inspection
- Analyzes logs for both present and missing entries
- Traces architectural changes through git history

### 3. Problem Investigation Flow
```
1. Check if existing tests capture the issue
2. Run tests in Docker environment
3. Analyze logs for missing operations
4. Use git history to understand changes
5. Apply targeted fixes
6. Verify with automated tests
```

## Key Commands

### Test Execution
```bash
# Use the async test runner (avoids timeouts)
./scripts/pytest-for-claude.sh tests/path/to/test.py -v

# Check test progress
./scripts/check-test-progress.sh

# Run tests in Docker service
docker compose exec -T <service> pytest tests/...
```

### Log Analysis
```bash
# Follow service logs with pattern matching
docker compose logs -f <service> | grep -E "pattern1|pattern2"

# Check recent logs
docker compose logs --since 5m <service>

# Look for missing logs (as important as errors)
docker compose logs <service> | grep "Expected message"
```

### Git Investigation
```bash
# Find when code changed
git log --oneline -- path/to/file.py

# Search for pattern introduction/removal
git log -S "search_pattern" --oneline

# See specific commit changes
git show <commit-hash>
```

## Common Patterns & Solutions

### Pattern: "AI responses not persisting"
- **Symptom**: Data appears but doesn't survive refresh
- **Check**: SSE/streaming endpoints for save timing
- **Solution**: Save before yielding termination signals

### Pattern: "Works locally, fails in Docker"
- **Symptom**: Different behavior in different environments
- **Check**: Service dependencies and environment variables
- **Solution**: Always test in Docker environment

### Pattern: "No errors but feature broken"
- **Symptom**: Silent failures
- **Check**: Missing log entries
- **Solution**: Trace execution to find where code stops

## Best Practices

### DO:
- Start with existing tests
- Use Docker for all testing
- Check git history for context
- Look for missing logs
- Test in the real environment
- Read test TODOs and comments

### DON'T:
- Create multiple test files for same issue
- Test locally when services are Dockerized
- Add complex debugging before simple checks
- Ignore existing test infrastructure
- Assume code is being executed

## Debugging Checklist

Before investigating:
- [ ] Is there an existing test for this issue?
- [ ] What do test comments/TODOs say?
- [ ] When did this last work?

During investigation:
- [ ] Am I testing in Docker?
- [ ] Have I checked for missing logs?
- [ ] Have I verified service communication?
- [ ] Have I reviewed relevant git history?

After fixing:
- [ ] Do automated tests pass?
- [ ] Have I documented the fix?
- [ ] Have I updated relevant tests?

## Example Investigation

**Issue**: "AI responses not persisting after refresh"

1. **Check existing tests**:
   ```bash
   grep -r "persist" tests/
   # Found: test_logout_and_login_again with TODO about AI responses
   ```

2. **Run the test**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/pytest-for-claude.sh tests/e2e/test_real_auth_e2e.py::test_logout_and_login_again -v
   ```

3. **Check logs**:
   ```bash
   docker compose logs web-service | grep "Saving AI response"
   # No results - code not being reached
   ```

4. **Investigate flow**:
   - Found SSE saves after yielding `[DONE]`
   - EventSource closes connection immediately
   - Save code never executes

5. **Fix**: Move save before yield
6. **Verify**: Test now passes

## Meta-Lessons

1. **Environment Matters**: The same code behaves differently in different environments
2. **Tests Document Issues**: TODOs in tests often reveal known problems
3. **Simple First**: Start with grep before building monitoring tools
4. **History is Diagnostic**: Git commits tell the story of changes

## Tools & Scripts

- `./scripts/pytest-for-claude.sh` - Async test runner
- `./scripts/check-test-progress.sh` - Monitor test execution
- `docker compose exec -T` - Run commands in containers
- `docker compose logs` - Service log inspection

## When to Engage

Use the Tester agent when:
- Tests are failing mysteriously
- Features work locally but not in production
- Silent failures with no error messages
- Need to understand test infrastructure
- Debugging distributed system issues
