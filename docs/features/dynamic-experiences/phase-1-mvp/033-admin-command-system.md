# Admin Command System

## Overview

The GAIA platform includes a powerful **admin command framework** that enables world builders to manage game content with **zero LLM latency** using structured commands prefixed with `@`.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ @ prefix distinguishes admin commands from player commands
- ✅ Auto-discovery from markdown files in `admin-logic/` directory
- ✅ Instant execution via direct file access (<30ms response time)
- ✅ Complete CRUD operations for waypoints, locations, and items
- ✅ Safety mechanisms (CONFIRM required for destructive operations)
- ✅ Metadata tracking (created_by, last_modified, timestamps)
- ✅ No permission enforcement yet (placeholder for future RBAC)

## What Admin Commands Are

Admin commands are **content-driven commands** that world builders use to inspect, create, edit, and delete game content. Unlike player commands (look, go, collect) which are interpreted through LLM analysis, admin commands execute directly against the file system.

**Examples:**
- `@list waypoints` - List all GPS waypoints
- `@inspect waypoint 4` - View detailed waypoint info
- `@edit waypoint 8 name New Name` - Modify waypoint properties
- `@create waypoint test Test Waypoint` - Create new waypoint
- `@delete waypoint test CONFIRM` - Delete waypoint (requires confirmation)

## Directory Structure

Admin commands are stored separately from game commands:

```
/kb/experiences/{experience}/
├── game-logic/           # Player commands (look, go, collect, talk)
│   ├── look.md
│   ├── go.md
│   ├── collect.md
│   ├── inventory.md
│   └── talk.md
└── admin-logic/          # Admin commands (@ prefix required)
    ├── @list-waypoints.md
    ├── @inspect-waypoint.md
    ├── @edit-waypoint.md
    ├── @create-waypoint.md
    ├── @delete-waypoint.md
    ├── @list-items.md
    └── @inspect-item.md
```

**Key Distinction:**
- `game-logic/` - Commands available to all players
- `admin-logic/` - Commands restricted to admins (@ prefix)

## Creating a New Admin Command

### 1. Create Markdown File

Create `/kb/experiences/{experience}/admin-logic/@{command-name}.md`:

```markdown
---
command: @list-items
aliases: [@show items, @items]
description: List all items in the experience (admin only)
requires_location: false
requires_target: false
requires_admin: true
state_model_support: [shared, isolated]
---

# @list-items - Admin Command

## Intent Detection

This command handles:
- Admin queries: "@list items", "@show all items"
- Natural language: "@what items exist", "@show me the items"

**IMPORTANT**: All admin commands must start with @ symbol.

Natural language patterns:
- @list items
- @show items
- @what items exist
- @items

## Input Parameters

No parameters required - lists all items in experience.

## State Access

Required from world state:
- All item instances in `/kb/experiences/{experience}/instances/items/*.json`

## Execution Logic

1. **Scan instance directory** - Find all .json files in instances/items/
2. **Parse instance data** - Extract ID, template, location
3. **Build summary list** - Format as readable list
4. **Return narrative** - Show item count and details

## Response Format

Success response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "narrative": "Found 42 items in experience:\\n\\n1. #1 Dream Bottle (shelf_1)\\n2. #2 Fairy Dust (counter)\\n...",
  "available_actions": [
    "inspect item 1",
    "where item 2",
    "create item"
  ],
  "state_updates": null,
  "metadata": {
    "command_type": "list-items",
    "item_count": 42,
    "admin_command": true
  }
}
```

## Examples

### Example 1: List all items
**Input**: "@list items"
**State**: Admin user in wylding-woods
**Output**:
```
Found 42 items in Wylding Woods:

1. #1 Dream Bottle (turquoise) - shelf_1
2. #2 Dream Bottle (golden) - shelf_2
3. #3 Fairy Dust - counter
... (39 more)

Total: 42 items
```
**State Updates**: None (read-only command)

## Security

**NOTE**: This is an admin command (requires @ prefix). Permission checking to be added in future.

## Error Handling

### No items found
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "narrative": "No items found in this experience.",
  "available_actions": ["create item"],
  "metadata": {"item_count": 0}
}
```

### Missing @ prefix
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_command",
    "message": "Admin commands require @ prefix"
  },
  "narrative": "Admin commands must start with @. Try: @list items",
  "available_actions": ["@list items", "@inspect item"]
}
```
```

### 2. Frontmatter Requirements

**Required fields:**
- `command` - Primary command name with @ prefix (e.g., `@list-items`)
- `description` - Human-readable description
- `requires_admin: true` - **CRITICAL** - Marks as admin-only command

**Optional fields:**
- `aliases` - List of alternative command forms
- `requires_location` - Does command need location context?
- `requires_target` - Does command need a target object/ID?
- `state_model_support` - Which state models support this? `[shared, isolated]`

### 3. @ Prefix Convention

**All admin commands MUST:**
- Start with @ symbol in the command name
- Include @ in all aliases
- Be stored in `admin-logic/` directory
- Have `requires_admin: true` in frontmatter

**Example:**
```yaml
command: @edit-waypoint
aliases: [@modify waypoint, @update waypoint, @change waypoint]
requires_admin: true
```

## Auto-Discovery Process

The system automatically discovers admin commands at runtime by scanning both directories:

```python
# Simplified discovery process
async def _discover_available_commands(experience: str) -> tuple[dict, dict]:
    """
    Discover commands from both game-logic/ and admin-logic/ directories.

    Returns:
        Tuple of (command_mappings, admin_required_dict)
        - command_mappings: {command_name: [aliases]}
        - admin_required_dict: {command_name: bool}
    """
    commands = {}
    admin_required = {}

    # Scan game-logic/ directory
    for md_file in (kb_root / experience / "game-logic").glob("*.md"):
        frontmatter = parse_frontmatter(md_file)
        command_name = frontmatter.get("command")
        commands[command_name] = frontmatter.get("aliases", [])
        admin_required[command_name] = False  # Player commands

    # Scan admin-logic/ directory
    for md_file in (kb_root / experience / "admin-logic").glob("*.md"):
        frontmatter = parse_frontmatter(md_file)
        command_name = frontmatter.get("command")
        commands[command_name] = frontmatter.get("aliases", [])
        admin_required[command_name] = frontmatter.get("requires_admin", True)

    return commands, admin_required
```

**Implementation Location:** `app/services/kb/experience_endpoints.py`

## Testing Admin Commands

### Direct KB Endpoint Test

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/experience/interact" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: ${API_KEY}" \
  -d '{
    "message": "@list waypoints",
    "experience": "wylding-woods"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "narrative": "Found 37 waypoints in Wylding Woods:\n\n1. #4 NARR-TURN - Bus Stop...",
  "available_actions": ["@inspect waypoint 4", "@edit waypoint 8"],
  "metadata": {
    "command_type": "list-waypoints",
    "waypoint_count": 37,
    "admin_command": true
  }
}
```

### Via Chat Service (With Game Master Persona)

```bash
GAME_MASTER_ID="7b197909-8837-4ed5-a67a-a05c90e817f1"

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8666/api/v0.3/chat" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: ${API_KEY}" \
  -d '{
    "message": "@inspect waypoint 4",
    "experience": "wylding-woods",
    "stream": false,
    "persona_id": "'$GAME_MASTER_ID'"
  }'
```

## Command Detection Flow

1. User sends message: `"@list waypoints"`
2. `_discover_available_commands()` scans both `game-logic/` and `admin-logic/` directories
3. Parses frontmatter from all `.md` files to build command registry
4. Detects @ prefix → routes to admin command handler
5. LLM analyzes user intent against available admin commands
6. Routes to appropriate command markdown for execution

**Key Difference from Player Commands:**
- Player commands: `look`, `go`, `collect` - No prefix, LLM interpretation
- Admin commands: `@list`, `@inspect`, `@edit` - @ prefix, direct execution

## Permission System (Future)

Currently, admin commands are marked with `requires_admin: true` but **no enforcement is in place**. This is a placeholder for future RBAC implementation.

**Planned Implementation:**
```python
async def check_admin_permission(user_context: dict, command: str, requires_admin: bool):
    """
    Check if user has permission to execute admin command.

    Currently: Placeholder (always returns True)
    Future: Check user role against requires_admin flag
    """
    if not requires_admin:
        return True  # Player command, anyone can use

    # Future RBAC check
    user_role = user_context.get("role", "player")
    if user_role in ["admin", "world_builder", "game_master"]:
        return True

    raise PermissionError(f"Admin permission required for {command}")
```

**When Implementing:**
- Check `requires_admin` flag from frontmatter
- Validate user role from authentication context
- Return clear error message for unauthorized access
- Log admin actions for audit trail

## Safety Features

### CONFIRM Mechanism

Destructive operations (delete, reset) require explicit confirmation:

```bash
# ❌ Without CONFIRM - rejected
@delete waypoint test_wp

# Returns: "⚠️ Add CONFIRM to proceed: @delete waypoint test_wp CONFIRM"

# ✅ With CONFIRM - executes
@delete waypoint test_wp CONFIRM
```

**Implementation Pattern:**
```python
def handle_delete_command(args: list):
    confirm = args[-1].upper() if len(args) > required_args else ""
    if confirm != "CONFIRM":
        return {
            "success": False,
            "narrative": f"⚠️ Add CONFIRM to proceed: @delete waypoint {args[0]} CONFIRM"
        }

    # Execute deletion
    ...
```

### Metadata Tracking

All admin operations automatically track:
- `created_at` - ISO 8601 timestamp
- `created_by` - User ID from context
- `last_modified` - Updated on edits
- `last_modified_by` - Who made the change

**Example:**
```json
{
  "waypoint_id": "4_narr_turn_bus_stop",
  "name": "#4 NARR-TURN - Bus Stop",
  "metadata": {
    "created_at": "2025-10-26T18:00:00Z",
    "created_by": "admin@gaia.dev",
    "last_modified": "2025-10-28T09:30:00Z",
    "last_modified_by": "worldbuilder@gaia.dev"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Use @ Prefix
```bash
# ✅ Correct
@list waypoints
@inspect waypoint 4

# ❌ Wrong - will be treated as player command
list waypoints
inspect waypoint 4
```

### 2. Provide Clear Feedback
Admin commands should return:
- Clear success/error messages
- Counts and summaries (e.g., "Found 37 waypoints")
- Suggested next actions
- Relevant metadata

### 3. Handle Errors Gracefully
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "waypoint_not_found",
    "message": "Waypoint '999' does not exist"
  },
  "narrative": "❌ Waypoint '999' not found.\n\nTry: @list waypoints to see available waypoints",
  "available_actions": ["@list waypoints"]
}
```

### 4. Maintain Command Consistency
- Use consistent naming: `@{action}-{target}` (e.g., `@list-waypoints`, `@edit-item`)
- Include common aliases: `@list waypoints`, `@show waypoints`, `@waypoints`
- Follow CRUD patterns: list, inspect, create, edit, delete

### 5. Document Everything
Each admin command markdown should include:
- Clear intent detection patterns
- Input parameter descriptions
- Execution logic steps
- Response format examples
- Error handling scenarios
- Related commands

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Detected

**Symptom:** Admin command not recognized, defaults to player command

**Causes:**
- Missing @ prefix in command name
- Frontmatter parsing failed
- File not in `admin-logic/` directory
- Missing `command:` field in frontmatter

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check logs for discovery
docker logs gaia-kb-service-1 2>&1 | grep "Discovered command"

# Verify frontmatter format
cat /kb/experiences/{experience}/admin-logic/@{command}.md | head -15

# Ensure @ prefix in command field
grep "command:" /kb/experiences/{experience}/admin-logic/@{command}.md
```

### Permission Denied (Future)

**Symptom:** "Admin permission required" error

**Solution:**
- Verify user has admin role in authentication context
- Check `requires_admin: true` in command frontmatter
- Ensure user_context includes `role` field

### Missing CONFIRM

**Symptom:** Delete command rejected without CONFIRM

**Solution:**
```bash
# Add CONFIRM to command
@delete waypoint test_wp CONFIRM
```

## Performance

- **Command discovery:** ~10-20ms (cached per experience)
- **Admin command execution:** <30ms (direct file access, no LLM)
- **Player command execution:** ~1000-3000ms (LLM interpretation)

**Admin commands are 100x faster than player commands** because they bypass LLM interpretation.
