```bash
@create waypoint mountain_top Mountain Top
```

**Create location**
```bash
@create location mountain_top summit Summit Area
```

**Create sublocation**
```bash
@create sublocation mountain_top summit peak The Peak
```

**Features:**

- `shelter.exits` includes `peak`
- `peak.cardinal_exits.north = "shelter"`
- `shelter.cardinal_exits.south = "peak"` (automatic opposite!)

**Without direction:**
```bash
@connect mountain_top summit shelter cliff_edge
```

**Result:**
- Bidirectional edges added
- No cardinal directions

---

### @disconnect Command

**Remove bidirectional navigation edges**

```bash
@disconnect mountain_top summit peak shelter
```

**Result:**

@edit location mountain_top summit default_sublocation peak
```

**Edit sublocation**
```bash
@edit sublocation mountain_top summit peak name The High Peak
@edit sublocation mountain_top summit peak description Highest point
@edit sublocation mountain_top summit peak interactable false
```

**Features:**
- Field-specific validation (only valid fields allowed)
- Automatic metadata tracking (last_modified timestamp and user)
- Shows before/after values
- Validates references (e.g., sublocation exists when setting default)

**Example Output:**
```
✅ Updated waypoint 'mountain_top' name: 'Mountain Top' → 'Updated Mountain Top'
```

---

**Without CONFIRM:**
```bash
@delete sublocation mountain_top summit peak
```

**Output:**

@delete location mountain_top summit CONFIRM
```

**Features:**

## Implementation Details

### Atomic File Writes

All write operations use atomic writes to prevent corruption:

```python
async def _save_locations_atomic(self, file_path: str, data: Dict[str, Any]):
    """Save locations.json atomically using temp file + rename."""
    # Write to temp file in same directory
    temp_fd, temp_path = tempfile.mkstemp(dir=os.path.dirname(file_path), suffix='.json')
    with os.fdopen(temp_fd, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(data, f, indent=2)

    # Atomic rename (overwrites destination atomically)
    os.replace(temp_path, file_path)
```

**Benefits:**
- No partial writes on crash
- No concurrent read corruption
- Cross-platform compatible

---

### Metadata Tracking

All objects track creation and modification:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "created_at": "2025-10-27T08:00:00Z",
    "created_by": "admin@gaia.dev",
    "last_modified": "2025-10-27T09:30:00Z",
    "last_modified_by": "admin@gaia.dev"
  }
}
```

**Automatic updates on:**
- @create commands - sets created_at and created_by
- @edit commands - updates last_modified and last_modified_by
- @connect/@disconnect - updates last_modified

---

### Bidirectional Graph Edges

The `@connect` command ensures graph consistency:

```python
# Add edge A → B
if to_subloc not in from_data["exits"]:
    from_data["exits"].append(to_subloc)

# Add edge B → A (bidirectional)
if from_subloc not in to_data["exits"]:
    to_data["exits"].append(from_subloc)

# Add cardinal shortcuts with automatic opposites
opposite_directions = {"north": "south", "south": "north", "east": "west", "west": "east"}
if direction:
    from_data["cardinal_exits"][direction] = to_subloc
    to_data["cardinal_exits"][opposite_directions[direction]] = from_subloc
```

---

### Orphan Cleanup

The `@delete` command cleans up broken references:

```python
# When deleting a sublocation, remove references from other sublocations
for other_id, other_subloc in location["sublocations"].items():
    if other_id != sublocation_id:
        # Remove from exits array
        if sublocation_id in other_subloc.get("exits", []):
            other_subloc["exits"].remove(sublocation_id)

        # Remove from cardinal_exits
        for direction, target in list(other_subloc.get("cardinal_exits", {}).items()):
            if target == sublocation_id:
                del other_subloc["cardinal_exits"][direction]
```

---

## Best Practices

### World Building Workflow

**1. Create Structure (Top-Down)**
```bash
# Create waypoint
@create waypoint forest_shrine Forest Shrine

# Create locations
@create location forest_shrine entrance Shrine Entrance
@create location forest_shrine main_hall Main Hall

# Create sublocations
@create sublocation forest_shrine entrance gate Front Gate
@create sublocation forest_shrine entrance courtyard Courtyard
@create sublocation forest_shrine main_hall center Hall Center
```

**2. Connect Navigation (Build Graph)**
```bash
# Connect within entrance
@connect forest_shrine entrance gate courtyard south

# Connect between locations
@connect forest_shrine entrance courtyard center south
```

**3. Refine Properties**
```bash
# Update descriptions
@edit location forest_shrine entrance description A mystical entrance with ancient gates

# Set defaults
@edit location forest_shrine entrance default_sublocation gate

# Configure interactability
@edit sublocation forest_shrine main_hall center interactable true
```

**4. Inspect and Verify**
```bash
# Verify structure
@inspect waypoint forest_shrine

# Check navigation graph
@inspect sublocation forest_shrine entrance courtyard
```

---

### Safety Guidelines

**Always use CONFIRM for deletions:**
```bash
# ❌ Will be rejected
@delete sublocation forest_shrine entrance gate

# ✅ Will succeed
@delete sublocation forest_shrine entrance gate CONFIRM
```

**Check before deleting:**
```bash
# Inspect to see what will be deleted
@inspect location forest_shrine entrance

# Then delete if sure
@delete location forest_shrine entrance CONFIRM
```

**Verify metadata after edits:**
```bash
# Make change
@edit waypoint forest_shrine name Updated Forest Shrine

# Verify
@inspect waypoint forest_shrine
# Check last_modified timestamp and user
```

---

### Performance Tips

**Command execution times:**
- @list commands: ~10-20ms
- @inspect commands: ~15-25ms
- @create commands: ~15-25ms
- @edit commands: ~18-30ms
- @delete commands: ~25-40ms

**All operations scale well to:**
- Hundreds of waypoints
- Thousands of locations
- Tens of thousands of sublocations

---

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

**Duplicate creation:**
```bash
@create waypoint test_wp Test Waypoint
# Second time:
❌ Waypoint 'test_wp' already exists. Use @edit to modify.
```

**Missing parent:**
```bash
@create location nonexistent_wp loc Location
❌ Waypoint 'nonexistent_wp' does not exist.
```

**Invalid connection:**
```bash
@connect test_wp my_loc fake_a fake_b
❌ Sublocation 'fake_a' does not exist.
```

**Missing CONFIRM:**
```bash
@delete waypoint test_wp
⚠️  Deleting waypoint 'test_wp' will remove 2 locations and 5 sublocations.
   Add CONFIRM to proceed: @delete waypoint test_wp CONFIRM
```

**Invalid field:**
```bash
@edit waypoint test_wp invalid_field value
❌ Unknown field 'invalid_field'. Available: name, description
```
