# NPC Interaction System

## Overview

The GAIA platform includes a sophisticated **NPC conversation system** powered by LLMs that enables players to have natural, contextual dialogues with non-player characters. Each NPC maintains per-player relationship state, conversation history, and trust levels.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Natural language NPC conversations via `talk` command
- ✅ Per-player state tracking (trust, history, facts learned)
- ✅ LLM-powered authentic, in-character dialogue
- ✅ Trust/relationship system (0-100 scale)
- ✅ Conversation history (last 20 turns)
- ✅ Quest integration (NPCs can offer and track quests)
- ✅ Location-aware (must be in same location to talk)

## What is the Talk Command?

The `talk` command allows players to engage in natural conversations with NPCs. Unlike simple scripted responses, NPCs use LLM analysis to:
- Respond contextually to what the player says
- Remember previous conversations
- Build relationships over time
- Offer quests when trust is high enough
- Show emotions and personality

**Example Interaction:**
```
Player: "talk to Louisa"

Louisa: *looks up with wide, hopeful eyes, wings flickering nervously*

Oh! You... you can see me? I wasn't expecting a human to notice a small fairy like me.

*takes a small breath, smoothing her teal dress*

I'm Louisa. I've been watching the humans come and go through this shop for quite some time. But I've never had the courage to speak to one before.

*her green glow pulses softly*

You seem kind. Perhaps... perhaps you could help me with something rather urgent?

[Trust level: 45 → 52 (+7 for first kind interaction)]
```

## NPC State Management

### Three Layers of NPC Data

The system uses three distinct data structures:

#### 1. NPC Template (Shared Across All Players)

**Location:** `/kb/experiences/{exp}/templates/npcs/{npc_id}.md`

Contains the NPC's core definition:
- Name, appearance, personality
- Background story
- Current situation/motivation
- Quest information
- Default behavior

**Example:** `/kb/experiences/wylding-woods/templates/npcs/louisa.md`
```markdown
---
npc_id: louisa
name: Louisa
type: fairy
appearance: Dream Weaver fairy with green/teal wings
personality: Anxious, hopeful, responsible, caring
---

# Louisa - Dream Weaver Fairy

## Personality
Louisa is a gentle, anxious fairy who takes her role as guardian very seriously. She's naturally timid around humans but desperately needs help recovering stolen dreams.

## Current Situation
The mischievous blue elf Neebling has stolen all the dreams from Louisa's fairy community and bottled them up around Woander Store. Without their dreams, the fairies are listless and sad.

## Quest: Dream Bottle Recovery
Louisa needs help finding 4 dream bottles scattered around the store:
- Turquoise dream bottle (spiral symbol) - at shelf_1
- Golden dream bottle (star symbol) - at shelf_2
- Silver dream bottle (moon symbol) - at shelf_3
- Amber dream bottle (sun symbol) - at magic_mirror

Each bottle must be returned to the matching fairy house.

## Dialogue Style
- Uses actions in *italics* to show emotions
- Speaks tentatively with pauses and hesitations
- Becomes more confident as trust grows
- Expresses gratitude sincerely
```

#### 2. Player-Specific NPC State (Per Player)

**Location:** `/kb/experiences/{exp}/players/{user_id}/npcs/{npc_id}.json`

Tracks the relationship between this specific player and the NPC:
```json
{
  "npc_id": "louisa",
  "player_id": "jason@aeonia.ai",
  "first_met": "2025-10-28T16:45:00Z",
  "last_interaction": "2025-10-28T16:52:00Z",
  "total_conversations": 4,
  "trust_level": 58,
  "conversation_history": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2025-10-28T16:45:00Z",
      "player": "talk to Louisa",
      "npc": "*looks up with wide, hopeful eyes...*",
      "mood": "nervous_hopeful"
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2025-10-28T16:47:00Z",
      "player": "ask Louisa about the stolen dreams",
      "npc": "*fidgets with the edge of her dress...*",
      "mood": "anxious"
    }
  ],
  "facts_learned": [
    "player_knows_about_dream_theft",
    "player_knows_about_neebling",
    "player_agreed_to_help"
  ],
  "promises": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2025-10-28T16:50:00Z",
      "promise": "help_recover_dream_bottles",
      "status": "active"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "created_at": "2025-10-28T16:45:00Z",
    "_version": 4
  }
}
```

**Key Fields:**
- `trust_level` - 0-100 relationship score
- `conversation_history` - Last 20 conversation turns
- `facts_learned` - What the NPC knows about this player
- `promises` - Commitments made by either party
- `total_conversations` - Count of all interactions

#### 3. NPC Instance State (Shared State Model Only)

**Location:** `/kb/experiences/{exp}/instances/npcs/{npc_id}_{instance_id}.json`

For shared experiences (like wylding-woods), tracks the NPC's current state in the world:
```json
{
  "template": "louisa",
  "instance_id": 1,
  "semantic_name": "louisa",
  "current_location": "waypoint_28a/woander_store/entrance",
  "visible": true,
  "interactable": true,
  "current_mood": "anxious",
  "quest_status": {
    "dream_bottle_recovery": {
      "bottles_recovered": 2,
      "total_bottles": 4,
      "status": "in_progress"
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "created_at": "2025-10-26T18:00:00Z",
    "_version": 3
  }
}
```

## Trust/Relationship System

### Trust Levels (0-100)

| Range | Relationship | NPC Behavior |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| 0-20 | Stranger | Guarded, minimal information |
| 21-40 | Acquaintance | Polite but cautious |
| 41-60 | Friendly | Opens up more, shares concerns |
| 61-80 | Trusted Friend | Shares secrets, offers quests |
| 81-100 | Close Companion | Full trust, special rewards |

### Trust Changes

Trust increases through positive interactions:
- **First meeting (kind):** +7 to +10
- **Showing interest:** +2 to +4
- **Helping with quests:** +5 to +10
- **Giving gifts:** +3 to +8
- **Keeping promises:** +5 to +15

Trust decreases through negative actions:
- **Rudeness:** -10
- **Refusing help:** -5
- **Breaking promises:** -20
- **Betrayal:** -50

### Trust-Gated Content

Some content only unlocks at specific trust levels:
```python
# Example quest unlocking
if player_state["trust_level"] >= 60:
    # NPC offers special quest
    offer_special_quest()
elif player_state["trust_level"] >= 40:
    # NPC hints at problem
    hint_at_quest()
else:
    # NPC mentions it vaguely
    casual_mention()
```

## Conversation History

The system maintains the last 20 conversation turns for context:

```python
def add_to_conversation_history(
    player_state: dict,
    player_message: str,
    npc_response: str,
    mood: str,
    max_history: int = 20
) -> None:
    """Add conversation turn and maintain history limit."""

    player_state["conversation_history"].append({
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "player": player_message,
        "npc": npc_response,
        "mood": mood
    })

    # Trim to max history
    if len(player_state["conversation_history"]) > max_history:
        player_state["conversation_history"] = \
            player_state["conversation_history"][-max_history:]
```

**Benefits:**
- NPC remembers recent conversations
- Can reference previous topics
- Maintains narrative continuity
- Prevents repetitive responses

## LLM-Powered Dialogue Generation

### How It Works

When a player talks to an NPC:

1. **Load NPC Template** - Get personality, situation, quest info
2. **Load Player State** - Get trust level, conversation history
3. **Build System Prompt** - Combine template + state + guidelines
4. **Send to LLM** - Generate authentic response
5. **Parse Response** - Extract dialogue, mood, trust changes
6. **Update State** - Save conversation turn, update trust

### System Prompt Structure

```python
system_prompt = f"""You are {npc_template['name']}, an NPC in a fantasy game.

Personality: {npc_template['personality']}
Current Situation: {npc_template['current_situation']}
Quest: {npc_template['quest'] if 'quest' in npc_template else 'None'}

Relationship with player:
- Trust level: {player_state['trust_level']}/100
- Total conversations: {player_state['total_conversations']}
- Last interaction: {player_state['last_interaction']}

Guidelines:
- Stay in character at all times
- Respond naturally to what the player says
- Don't rush to exposition-dump the entire quest
- Show emotion through actions and tone
- Build trust through authentic interaction

Previous conversation:
{format_conversation_history(player_state['conversation_history'][-3:])}
"""
```

### Temperature and Creativity

```python
response = await llm_client.generate(
    system_prompt=system_prompt,
    user_prompt=player_message,
    temperature=0.8  # Higher for more creative/natural dialogue
)
```

**Why 0.8?**
- Makes dialogue feel more natural and varied
- Prevents robotic, repetitive responses
- Allows personality to shine through
- Still maintains character consistency

## Quest Integration

### Quest Lifecycle

1. **Quest Offered** - NPC mentions quest when trust level is high enough
2. **Quest Accepted** - Player agrees to help
3. **Quest In Progress** - Player works on objectives
4. **Quest Completed** - All objectives met, rewards given

### Quest State Tracking

Quests are tracked in both NPC state and player state:

```json
// In player's NPC state
{
  "npc_id": "louisa",
  "quests_offered": ["dream_bottle_recovery"],
  "facts_learned": ["player_agreed_to_help"]
}

// In player's quest state
{
  "quests": {
    "dream_bottle_recovery": {
      "status": "in_progress",
      "offered_by": "louisa",
      "offered_at": "2025-10-28T16:47:00Z",
      "accepted_at": "2025-10-28T16:50:00Z",
      "objectives": {
        "find_turquoise_bottle": {"status": "completed"},
        "find_golden_bottle": {"status": "completed"},
        "find_silver_bottle": {"status": "in_progress"},
        "find_amber_bottle": {"status": "pending"}
      },
      "progress": 2,
      "total_objectives": 4
    }
  }
}
```

### NPC Quest Responses

NPCs react to quest progress in conversations:

```python
# If quest in progress
if quest_status == "in_progress":
    completed = count_completed_objectives(quest)
    total = count_total_objectives(quest)

    npc_context += f"""
    Quest Progress: The player has completed {completed} of {total} objectives.
    Show encouragement and acknowledge their progress.
    """

# If quest completed
if quest_status == "completed":
    npc_context += """
    Quest Completed: The player has finished your quest!
    Express gratitude and give rewards.
    """
```

## Talk Command Usage

### Basic Syntax

```bash
# Talk to NPC (general greeting)
talk to Louisa

# Ask about specific topic
ask Louisa about the dreams

# Natural language greeting
Hello Louisa, how are you?

# Direct question
Louisa, what happened to the dreams?
```

### Command Detection Patterns

The `talk` command recognizes many natural language patterns:
- `talk to [npc]`
- `speak with [npc]`
- `greet [npc]`
- `hello [npc]`
- `hi [npc]`
- `ask [npc] about [topic]`
- `tell [npc] about [topic]`
- `[npc], [question/statement]`

  }'
```

## Creating New NPCs

### Step 1: Create NPC Template

Create `/kb/experiences/{exp}/templates/npcs/{npc_id}.md`:

```markdown
---
npc_id: merchant_bob
name: Bob the Merchant
type: human
appearance: Portly merchant with a bushy beard
personality: Jovial, shrewd, loves to haggle
---

# Bob the Merchant

## Personality
Bob is a cheerful merchant who loves a good deal. He's been running his shop for 30 years and knows everyone in town.

## Current Situation
Bob's shop has been losing business to the new market. He's considering closing but doesn't want to give up the family business.

## Quest: Find Lost Ledger
Bob's grandfather's ledger has gone missing. It contains recipes for special potions that could save the shop.

## Dialogue Style
- Uses merchant terminology
- Often mentions prices and deals
- Hearty laugh ("Ho ho!")
- Protective of his shop's reputation
```

### Step 2: Add NPC to Location

Add to location's items/NPCs list:
```json
{
  "location": "market_square",
  "sublocation": "bobs_shop",
  "npcs": [
    {
      "template": "merchant_bob",
      "instance_id": 1,
      "semantic_name": "Bob",
      "visible": true,
      "interactable": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Test Conversation

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/experience/interact" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: ${API_KEY}" \
  -d '{
    "message": "talk to Bob",
    "experience": "your-experience"
  }'
```

## Error Handling

### NPC Not Found

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "npc_not_found",
    "message": "NPC 'unknown_npc' does not exist"
  },
  "narrative": "❌ There's no one named 'unknown_npc' here.\n\nTry looking around to see who's present.",
  "available_actions": ["look around"]
}
```

### NPC Not in Location

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "npc_not_present",
    "message": "Louisa is not in this location"
  },
  "narrative": "❌ Louisa is not here.\n\nYou last saw Louisa at the entrance. You could go there to find her.",
  "available_actions": ["go to entrance", "look around"],
  "metadata": {
    "npc_last_known_location": "entrance"
  }
}
```

### No Target Specified

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "missing_target",
    "message": "Please specify who you want to talk to"
  },
  "narrative": "Talk to who?\n\nNPCs here: Louisa (at entrance), Woander (at counter)\n\nTry: talk to Louisa",
  "available_actions": ["talk to Louisa", "talk to Woander", "look around"]
}
```

## State Model Support

### Isolated State (west-of-house)
- Each player has completely separate NPC states
- NPC conversations don't affect other players
- Perfect for single-player story experiences

### Shared State (wylding-woods)
- NPC relationships are per-player
- NPC location/availability is shared
- If one player moves an NPC, all players see the change
- Conversation history remains private to each player

## Performance Considerations

- **LLM call per conversation:** ~1-3 seconds
- **State file I/O:** <50ms
- **Trust calculation:** <5ms
- **Conversation history lookup:** <10ms

**Total response time:** 1-3 seconds (dominated by LLM)

## Best Practices

### 1. Write Rich NPC Templates
```markdown
# Good Template
- Detailed personality traits
- Clear motivation/goals
- Specific dialogue style notes
- Emotional range

# Poor Template
- Vague description
- No clear motivation
- Generic personality
```

### 2. Design Meaningful Trust Progression
```python
# Good: Trust gates content naturally
if trust >= 60:
    reveal_quest()
elif trust >= 40:
    hint_at_problem()

# Poor: All content available immediately
reveal_everything()
```

### 3. Maintain Conversation Context
- Use last 3-5 conversation turns in LLM prompt
- Reference previous topics naturally
- Don't repeat identical responses

### 4. Show Don't Tell
```markdown
# Good (shows emotion)
*fidgets with dress, wings drooping*
"I... I'm not sure I can do this."

# Poor (tells emotion)
"I feel anxious about this."
```

### 5. Balance Quest Exposition
```markdown
# Good (gradual revelation)
First conversation: Mentions problem vaguely
Second: Shares more details
Third: Offers quest if trust is high

# Poor (immediate dump)
First conversation: Explains entire quest in detail
```
