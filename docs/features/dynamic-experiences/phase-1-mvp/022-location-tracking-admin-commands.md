# Location Tracking & Admin Commands Design

**Status:** üîµ Spec
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Related:** [021-kb-command-processing-spec.md](./021-kb-command-processing-spec.md)

## Overview

This document specifies a hierarchical location tracking system and admin command set for creating a Zork-like AR MMO experience. Players navigate through a nested location hierarchy (Waypoint ‚Üí Location ‚Üí Sublocation), while admins can dynamically create and edit world content using MUD/MOO-style @ commands.

**Design Goals:**
- Natural language player commands for exploration and interaction
- MUD/MOO-inspired admin commands (@ prefix) for world building
- Hierarchical location context (room-location-sublocation pattern)
- No RBAC initially - focus on command functionality
- File-based content storage (JSON) for MVP phase

## Location Hierarchy Model

### Three-Tier Structure

```
Waypoint/Room (GPS-anchored AR location or scene-based container)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Location (named area within waypoint - building/zone)
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sublocation (interactable spot within location)
```

**Why this structure?**
- **Waypoint/Room**: GPS-based or scene-based container (e.g., GPS coordinate, VR scene)
- **Location**: Named area within waypoint (like a building, shop, clearing)
- **Sublocation**: Interactive spot within location (shelf, door, corner, object)

**Example 1: The Fairy Grove (Natural Environment)**
```
waypoint_28a (The Fairy Grove - GPS: 37.7749, -122.4194)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ clearing (central clearing)
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shelf_1 (mushroom shelf)
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fairy_door_1 (spiral fairy house door)
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ancient_tree (the ancient oak)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pond_area (quiet pond)
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ water_edge (pond's edge)
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lily_pad (floating lily pad)
```

**Example 2: Woander Store (Indoor Location)**
```
waypoint_28a (Woander Store Area - GPS: 37.906233, -122.547721)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ woander_store (mystical shop interior)
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ entrance (store entrance)
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shelf_area (display shelves)
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fairy_doors (wall of fairy doors)
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ fountain (magical fountain)
```

            "cardinal_exits": {
              "east": "shelf_area"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Graph Representation Options:**

### Option 1: Embedded Adjacency Lists (Recommended for MVP)

Each sublocation contains its own `exits` array - this forms an **adjacency list representation** of the graph.

```json
"entrance": {
  "exits": ["shelf_area", "fairy_doors"]  // ‚Üê Adjacency list: neighbors of "entrance"
}
```

**Graph Structure:**
```
entrance ‚Üê‚Üí shelf_area
    ‚Üì           ‚Üì
fairy_doors  fountain
```

**Pros:**
- Simple, co-located with location data
- Easy to read and edit
- No separate graph file needed
- Fast lookup: O(1) to get neighbors

**Cons:**
- Bidirectional connections require duplication (entrance ‚Üí shelf_area AND shelf_area ‚Üí entrance)
- No validation that connections are symmetric
- Harder to add edge metadata (weights, conditions)

**Implementation:**
```python
def get_exits(location, sublocation):
    """Get all reachable sublocations from current position."""
    subloc_data = locations[waypoint][location]["sublocations"][sublocation]
    return subloc_data.get("exits", [])

def can_move_to(current, target):
    """Check if movement is allowed."""
    return target in get_exits(current["location"], current["sublocation"])
```

### Option 2: Centralized Edge List (For Complex Systems)

Store navigation graph separately from location metadata.

**File:** `world/navigation.json`

```json
{
  "waypoint_28a_store": {
    "woander_store": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "from": "entrance",
          "to": "shelf_area",
          "bidirectional": true,
          "cost": 1,
          "cardinal": "north"
        },
        {
          "from": "entrance",
          "to": "fairy_doors",
          "bidirectional": true,
          "cost": 1,
          "cardinal": "east"
        },
        {
          "from": "shelf_area",
          "to": "fountain",
          "bidirectional": true,
          "cost": 2,
          "cardinal": "west"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Pros:**
- Single source of truth for navigation
- Easy to add edge metadata (cost, conditions, one-way vs bidirectional)
- Simple validation (check bidirectional consistency)
- Better for pathfinding algorithms (A*, Dijkstra)

**Cons:**
- Separate file to maintain
- Extra lookup when checking exits
- Overkill for simple navigation

**Implementation:**
```python
def build_adjacency_list(edges):
    """Convert edge list to adjacency list for fast lookups."""
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for edge in edges:
        graph[edge["from"]].append(edge["to"])
        if edge.get("bidirectional", True):
            graph[edge["to"]].append(edge["from"])
    return graph

def get_exits(location, sublocation):
    """Get exits using centralized graph."""
    return navigation_graph[waypoint][location][sublocation]
```

### Option 3: Hybrid (Recommended Approach)

**For MVP Phase 1-2:** Use **embedded adjacency lists** (`exits` arrays in locations.json)
- Simple, fast, co-located with location data
- Sufficient for 5-20 sublocations per location

**For Phase 3-4 or complex systems:** Migrate to **centralized edge list** (navigation.json)
- Add when you need: pathfinding, conditional exits, one-way doors, edge metadata
- Can auto-generate from embedded exits as migration path

**Migration command:**
```
Admin: "@export navigation woander_store"
Game: ‚úì Exported navigation graph to world/navigation_woander_store.json
      (50 edges extracted from 25 sublocations)
```

### Ensuring Graph Consistency

**Problem:** With embedded adjacency lists, bidirectional connections can become inconsistent.

**Example of inconsistency:**
```json
"entrance": {"exits": ["shelf_area"]},
"shelf_area": {"exits": ["fountain"]}  // ‚Üê Missing "entrance"!
```

**Solution: Validation on @connect**

```python
async def _admin_connect_sublocations(self, from_id, to_id, bidirectional=True):
    """Add navigation link between sublocations."""

    # Add forward connection
    from_subloc["exits"].append(to_id)

    if bidirectional:
        # Add reverse connection automatically
        to_subloc["exits"].append(from_id)

    return {
        "success": True,
        "narrative": f"‚úì Connected {from_id} ‚Üî {to_id} (bidirectional)"
    }

async def _validate_graph_consistency(self, location_data):
    """Check that all bidirectional connections are symmetric."""
    issues = []

    for subloc_id, subloc_data in location_data["sublocations"].items():
        for exit_id in subloc_data.get("exits", []):
            # Check reverse connection exists
            exit_subloc = location_data["sublocations"][exit_id]
            if subloc_id not in exit_subloc.get("exits", []):
                issues.append(f"{subloc_id} ‚Üí {exit_id} but not {exit_id} ‚Üí {subloc_id}")

    return issues
```

### Graph Representation Summary

| Aspect | Embedded (MVP) | Centralized (Advanced) |
|--------|----------------|------------------------|
| **File** | `locations.json` with `exits` arrays | Separate `navigation.json` |
| **Structure** | Adjacency list (embedded) | Edge list (centralized) |
| **Lookup Speed** | O(1) - direct array access | O(1) - prebuilt adjacency list |
| **Validation** | Manual or @connect command | Automatic consistency checks |
| **Pathfinding** | BFS on adjacency list | A*/Dijkstra with edge weights |
| **Use Case** | Simple navigation, MVP | Complex systems, conditional exits |

**Recommendation:** Start with **embedded adjacency lists** (Option 1), add validation to `@connect` command, migrate to **centralized edge list** (Option 2) when you need:
- Pathfinding with costs
- Conditional navigation (locked doors, quest gates)
- One-way passages
- 50+ sublocations in a single location

## Player Commands

### Navigation Commands

| Command | Example | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `go <location>` | "go woander_store" | Move to a different location within current waypoint |
| `go to <sublocation>` | "go to shelf_area" | Move to specific sublocation (graph-based connection) |
| `move to <sublocation>` | "move to shelf_1" | Alias for `go to` |
| `enter <location>` | "enter woander_store" | Enter a location from waypoint |
| `exit` / `leave` | "exit" | Leave current location (go back to previous) |
| `back` | "go back" | Return to previous location in history |
| `north` / `south` / `east` / `west` | "go north" | **Optional** cardinal movement (only if explicitly mapped) |

**Note on Navigation:** Movement is primarily **graph-based** using named sublocation connections (e.g., "go to shelf_area", "move to fountain"). Cardinal directions (north/south/east/west) are optional shortcuts that can be defined for specific connections, but are NOT required. This allows natural indoor navigation where "go to the shelves" is more intuitive than "go north".

## Session Context Tracking

### Player Position in Graph

**How We Track Position:**

The player's current position in the navigation graph is stored in a **session state file** unique to each player. This file persists between commands and enables stateful navigation.

**File:** `experiences/wylding-woods/sessions/{user_id}/state.json`

```json
{
  "user_id": "jason@aeonia.ai",
  "experience": "wylding-woods",

  "current_position": {
    "waypoint": "waypoint_28a_store",
    "location": "woander_store",
    "sublocation": "entrance"
  },

  "location_history": [
    {
      "waypoint": "waypoint_28a_store",
      "location": "woander_store",
      "sublocation": "shelf_area",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-27T08:05:00Z",
      "action": "go to entrance"
    },
    {
      "waypoint": "waypoint_28a_store",
      "location": "woander_store",
      "sublocation": "fairy_doors",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-27T08:03:00Z",
      "action": "go to shelf_area"
    }
  ],

  "inventory": [
    {
      "instance_id": "dream_bottle_1",
      "template": "dream_bottle",
      "acquired_at": "2025-10-27T08:05:00Z"
    }
  ],

  "metadata": {
    "session_start": "2025-10-27T07:00:00Z",
    "last_command": "2025-10-27T08:10:00Z",
    "total_moves": 15
  }
}
```

**Quest progress stored separately:**

**File:** `experiences/wylding-woods/sessions/{user_id}/progress.json`

```json
{
  "user_id": "jason@aeonia.ai",
  "quests": {
    "bottle_quest": {
      "status": "in_progress",
      "checkpoints": ["collected_bottle"],
      "started_at": "2025-10-27T07:30:00Z"
    }
  },
  "achievements": [],
  "statistics": {
    "items_collected": 5,
    "locations_visited": 12
  }
}
```

### Position Update Flow

**1. Player Issues Movement Command:**
```
You: "go to shelf_area"
```

**2. KB Agent Processes Command:**
```python
async def execute_game_command_v2(command, experience, user_context):
    # Load current session state
    session = await self._load_session(experience, user_context["user_id"])

    # Current position from session
    current_pos = session["current_position"]
    # ‚Üí {"waypoint": "waypoint_28a_store", "location": "woander_store", "sublocation": "entrance"}

    # Parse command
    parsed = await self._parse_player_command(command, session)
    # ‚Üí {"action": "go", "target": "shelf_area"}

    # Validate movement using graph
    if await self._can_move_to(current_pos, parsed["target"]):
        # Update position
        session["current_position"]["sublocation"] = parsed["target"]

        # Add to history
        session["location_history"].insert(0, {
            "waypoint": current_pos["waypoint"],
            "location": current_pos["location"],
            "sublocation": current_pos["sublocation"],
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            "action": command
        })

        # Save updated session
        await self._save_session(experience, user_context["user_id"], session)

        return {
            "success": True,
            "narrative": "You move to the shelf area...",
            "new_position": session["current_position"]
        }
```

**3. Validation Against Graph:**
```python
async def _can_move_to(self, current_pos, target_sublocation):
    """Check if movement is valid using navigation graph."""

    # Load location data
    location_data = await self._load_location(
        current_pos["waypoint"],
        current_pos["location"]
    )

    # Get current sublocation's exits
    current_subloc = location_data["sublocations"][current_pos["sublocation"]]
    exits = current_subloc.get("exits", [])

    # Check if target is in exits array (adjacency list)
    if target_sublocation in exits:
        return True

    # Also check cardinal directions
    cardinal_exits = current_subloc.get("cardinal_exits", {})
    if target_sublocation in cardinal_exits.values():
        return True

    return False
```

### Session Lifecycle

**Session Creation (First Command):**
```python
async def _load_session(self, experience, user_id):
    """Load or create player session."""
    session_path = f"{KB_BASE}/experiences/{experience}/sessions/{user_id}/state.json"

    if not os.path.exists(session_path):
        # Create new session at experience's starting location
        default_waypoint = await self._get_default_waypoint(experience)
        default_location = default_waypoint["locations"][0]  # First location
        default_sublocation = default_location["default_sublocation"]

        session = {
            "user_id": user_id,
            "experience": experience,
            "current_position": {
                "waypoint": default_waypoint["waypoint_id"],
                "location": default_location["location_id"],
                "sublocation": default_sublocation
            },
            "location_history": [],
            "inventory": [],
            "metadata": {
                "session_start": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
                "last_command": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
                "total_moves": 0
            }
        }

        await self._save_session(experience, user_id, session)
    else:
        # Load existing session
        with open(session_path, 'r') as f:
            session = json.load(f)

    return session
```

**Session Persistence:**
```python
async def _save_session(self, experience, user_id, session):
    """Save session state to disk."""
    session_path = f"{KB_BASE}/experiences/{experience}/sessions/{user_id}/state.json"

    # Update metadata
    session["metadata"]["last_command"] = datetime.utcnow().isoformat()

    # Ensure directory exists
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(session_path), exist_ok=True)

    # Write atomically (temp file + rename)
    temp_path = f"{session_path}.tmp"
    with open(temp_path, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(session, f, indent=2)
    os.rename(temp_path, session_path)
```

**Session Timeout:**
```python
async def _is_session_expired(self, session, timeout_hours=24):
    """Check if session should be reset."""
    last_command = datetime.fromisoformat(session["metadata"]["last_command"])
    elapsed = datetime.utcnow() - last_command
    return elapsed.total_seconds() > (timeout_hours * 3600)
```

### Position Tracking in Practice

**Example: Complete Movement Cycle**

```
Initial state (sessions/jason@aeonia.ai/state.json):
{
  "current_position": {"waypoint": "waypoint_28a_store", "location": "woander_store", "sublocation": "entrance"}
}

Command: "go to shelf_area"

Validation:
1. Load locations.json ‚Üí woander_store ‚Üí entrance ‚Üí exits = ["shelf_area", "fairy_doors"]
2. Check if "shelf_area" in exits ‚Üí YES ‚úì
3. Movement allowed

Update state:
{
  "current_position": {"waypoint": "waypoint_28a_store", "location": "woander_store", "sublocation": "shelf_area"},
  "location_history": [
    {"sublocation": "entrance", "timestamp": "2025-10-27T08:10:00Z", "action": "go to shelf_area"}
  ]
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "narrative": "You move to the shelf area. Three wooden shelves line the walls...",
  "new_position": {"waypoint": "waypoint_28a_store", "location": "woander_store", "sublocation": "shelf_area"}
}
```

**Why Session Files Matter:**

1. **Stateful Navigation:** Player doesn't repeat location in every command
   - ‚úì "look" ‚Üí uses current_position automatically
   - ‚úì "go to shelf_area" ‚Üí validates against current_position.exits

2. **History Tracking:** Enable "back" command
   - Player: "back" ‚Üí retrieves location_history[0] ‚Üí moves there

3. **Inventory Persistence:** Items survive between sessions
   - Player collects bottle ‚Üí saved to session ‚Üí still in inventory tomorrow

4. **Quest Progress:** Long-term quest tracking
   - Separate progress.json for checkpoint tracking
   - Doesn't clutter position state

**Key Files Involved:**

| File | Purpose | Updated On |
|------|---------|------------|
| `sessions/{user_id}/state.json` | Current position + inventory | Every command |
| `sessions/{user_id}/progress.json` | Quest checkpoints | Quest events only |
| `world/locations.json` | Graph structure (exits arrays) | Admin commands only |
| `instances/items/*.json` | Item instances in world | Item spawn/move/collect |

**Position Tracking Summary:**

- **Where:** Session state file per player
- **What:** `current_position: {waypoint, location, sublocation}`
- **How:** Load ‚Üí validate against graph ‚Üí update ‚Üí save
- **Why:** Enables stateful navigation without repeating location

## Example Gameplay Flows

### Player Flow 1: Exploration and Quest (Natural Environment)

```
You: "where am I?"
Game: You are at The Fairy Grove (waypoint_28a), standing in the Central Clearing,
      currently at the Mushroom Shelf (shelf_1).

You: "look around"
Game: You're in a peaceful clearing surrounded by ancient trees. You can see:
      - A mushroom shelf (shelf_1) with a glowing bottle
      - A tiny fairy house door (fairy_door_1) marked with a spiral
      - An ancient oak tree (ancient_tree) with deep roots

You: "examine the bottle"
Game: You see a dream bottle with a turquoise glow and a spiral symbol etched on its side.

You: "take the bottle"
Game: You carefully pick up the dream bottle. It feels warm to the touch.
      [Inventory updated: dream_bottle_1 added]

You: "go to the pond"
Game: You walk toward the quiet pond. The air grows cooler near the water.
      [Location updated: waypoint_28a ‚Üí pond_area ‚Üí water_edge]

You: "back"
Game: You return to the Central Clearing.
      [Location updated: waypoint_28a ‚Üí clearing ‚Üí shelf_1]

You: "give bottle to fairy door"
Game: You place the dream bottle near the spiral fairy house door. The door glows briefly!

Game: You move to the fairy doors area. Four small doors decorated with various symbols...

You: "examine fairy_door_1"
Game: A small door decorated with a spiral symbol. It seems to be waiting for something...

You: "use dream_bottle at fairy_door_1"
Game: The bottle dissolves into light and flows into the door! The spiral glows brightly.
      [Quest progress: bottle_quest ‚Üí completed]

You: "go north"
Game: [If cardinal_exits defined] You move to the entrance.
      [If not defined] I don't understand that direction. Try "exits" to see where you can go.
```

**Note:** This flow demonstrates **graph-based navigation** where players use place names ("go to shelf_area") rather than cardinal directions. The final "go north" command shows optional cardinal shortcuts - they work if defined, but aren't required for navigation.

```
You: "look"
Game: You see a dream bottle here, but it looks wrong...

You: "@sudo edit item dream_bottle_1 state.glow_color purple"
Game: [Admin] ‚úì Updated dream_bottle_1: state.glow_color = "purple"

You: "look"
Game: You see a dream bottle with a purple glow and a spiral symbol...
      Much better!

You: "take dream_bottle"
Game: You carefully pick up the dream bottle. It feels warm to the touch.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

**Player Commands:**
```python
async def test_player_navigation():
    """Test go/move/enter commands update session context"""
    result = await kb_agent.execute_game_command_v2(
        command="go to the pond",
        experience="wylding-woods",
        user_context={"user_id": "test_user", "role": "player"}
    )
    assert result["success"] == True
    assert result["session"]["current_location"] == "pond_area"

async def test_player_inventory():
    """Test take/drop commands modify inventory"""
    # ... test inventory changes
```

**Admin Commands:**
```python
async def test_admin_create_location():
    """Test @create location command"""
    result = await kb_agent.execute_game_command_v2(
        command="@create location waypoint_28a test_area",
        experience="wylding-woods",
        user_context={"user_id": "admin", "role": "admin"}
    )
    assert result["success"] == True
    # Verify location exists in locations.json
```

### Integration Tests

**Full Player Flow:**
```python
async def test_full_exploration_flow():
    """Test complete exploration and quest completion"""
    # Start at waypoint
    # Look around
    # Take item
    # Navigate to different location
    # Return item to quest location
    # Verify quest completion
```

**Full Admin Flow:**
```python
async def test_full_world_building_flow():
    """Test creating waypoint ‚Üí location ‚Üí sublocation ‚Üí item"""
    # Create waypoint
    # Add location
    # Add sublocation
    # Spawn item
    # Verify player can interact with created content
```

### Manual Testing Scenarios

**Player Testing:**
1. Navigation: Move through multiple locations, test back command
2. Observation: Look at different sublocations, examine items
3. Interaction: Take items, check inventory, drop items
4. Quest: Complete full quest chain with checkpoints

**Admin Testing:**
1. Creation: Build complete waypoint from scratch
2. Editing: Modify existing content, verify changes appear
3. Deletion: Remove content, verify cascade deletes
4. Import/Export: Export waypoint, modify JSON, reimport

## File Structure

Complete directory structure for the enhanced system:

```

    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ woander_store_20251027_093000.json
```

**Key Files:**
- **world/locations.json**: Master location hierarchy (waypoints ‚Üí locations ‚Üí sublocations)
- **world/navigation.json**: Optional navigation graph for complex pathfinding
- **sessions/{user_id}/state.json**: Player's current position and inventory
- **exports/**: Admin-generated backups and world exports

## Dependencies

**Existing Systems:**
- Instance management (`kb_agent.py` lines 279-442)
- Game commands API (`game_commands_api.py`)
- LLM command parsing (Claude Haiku 4.5)
- Session state storage (file-based JSON)

**New Dependencies:**
- Location hierarchy data model (`world/locations.json`)
- Session context management (`sessions/{user_id}.json`)
- Admin command parser (simpler than player commands)
- Location validation and cascade delete logic
- Navigation graph support (optional `world/navigation.json`)

**No Changes Required:**
- Chat service integration (already routes to KB)
- Authentication system (role-based routing)
- Instance file structure (items/npcs JSON files)

## Integration with Existing System

### Backward Compatibility

**No Breaking Changes:**
- Existing `execute_game_command()` method remains functional
- New `execute_game_command_v2()` is additive, not replacement
- Current instance management methods unchanged
- File-based storage structure extended, not replaced

**Enhanced Parsing:**
```python
# Old: Location extraction from command text
parsed_action = {
    "action": "collect",
    "target": "dream_bottle",
    "waypoint": "waypoint_28a",  # From command or context
    "sublocation": "shelf_1"      # From command or context
}

# New: Plus session-based location tracking
session = {
    "current_waypoint": "waypoint_28a",
    "current_location": "woander_store",
    "current_sublocation": "entrance",
    "location_history": [...]
}
```

**Player State Always Tracked:**
- Every command updates `sessions/{user_id}/state.json`
- `look` command automatically uses current location context
- `go/move/enter` commands update location and return new description
- No need to repeat location in every command (unless changing location)

### Migration Path

**Phase 1: Parallel Systems**
- Both `execute_game_command()` and `execute_game_command_v2()` available
- Existing clients continue using v1
- New clients can opt into v2 with location tracking

**Phase 2: Gradual Migration**
- Add session state to existing players
- Enable location hierarchy for new waypoints
- Keep backward compatibility for simple commands

**Phase 3: Full Adoption**
- All commands route through v2
- v1 deprecated but still available
- Complete location hierarchy coverage

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

**Not Included in Initial Implementation:**
1. **RBAC Content Filtering** - Filter locations/items by user permissions
2. **Real-time Multiplayer** - See other players in same location
3. **Location Events** - Time-based or trigger-based events at locations
4. **Dynamic Weather** - Location descriptions change with weather
5. **NPC Schedules** - NPCs move between locations on schedule
6. **Location Locking** - Require keys/quests to access locations
7. **Database Backend** - Replace file-based storage with PostgreSQL
8. **Web Admin UI** - Visual world editor instead of text commands

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Hierarchical Location Tracking (Waypoint ‚Üí Location ‚Üí Sublocation)
**Why:** Provides the right level of granularity for both GPS-based AR (waypoints) and detailed indoor navigation (locations/sublocations). Mirrors real-world spatial hierarchy while enabling Zork-style interaction depth.

**Benefit:** Players always know where they are, context is preserved across commands, and developers can reason about spatial relationships easily.

### 2. Admin Commands Prefixed with @
**Why:** MUD/MOO tradition that's instantly recognizable and easy to parse. Clear visual distinction prevents accidental world edits during gameplay.

**Benefit:** Single character distinguishes builder mode from player mode. Familiar to anyone with MUD/MOO experience.

### 3. Location as Primary Context
**Why:** Natural conversation flow - "look" always uses current location, "take X" looks here first, movement updates context automatically.

**Benefit:** Players don't need to repeat location in every command. More natural language interaction.

### 4. File-Based Until Scale Demands DB
**Why:** MVP can move fast with JSON files. Clear migration path to PostgreSQL when needed (50k+ instances).

**Benefit:** Simple, version-controllable, fast to iterate. No database setup complexity for initial development.

### 5. Natural Language + Structured Commands (Player) vs Structured Only (Admin)
**Why:** Players should feel like they're having a conversation. Admins are building content and need precision.

**Examples:**
- Player: "pick up the bottle" OR "take dream_bottle" (both work)
- Admin: "@spawn item dream_bottle at waypoint_28a clearing shelf_1" (precise)

**Benefit:** Best of both worlds - natural player experience, precise admin tooling.

### 6. Mode Switching (@admin, @play, @sudo)
**Why:** Admins often need to quickly test player experience, then make edits, then test again.

**Benefit:** Seamless context switching without logging out/in. @sudo enables one-off edits during playtesting.

### 7. Session-Based Location Tracking
**Why:** Stateless parsing was forcing players to specify location every time. Stateful sessions enable natural conversation flow.

**Benefit:** "look" ‚Üí "take bottle" ‚Üí "go pond" works naturally without repeating location context.

### 8. Graph-Based Navigation with Optional Cardinal Directions
**Why:** Indoor spaces don't have clear north/south/east/west. "Go to the shelves" is more natural than "go north". Cardinal directions are shortcuts, not requirements.

**Implementation:**
- Primary: Graph links between sublocations (exits array)
- Optional: Cardinal shortcuts (cardinal_exits object)
- Player experience: "go to shelf_area" (always works) or "go north" (works if defined)

**Benefit:** Natural navigation for any environment (indoor stores, outdoor forests, abstract spaces) without forcing spatial metaphors that don't fit.

## Open Questions

1. **Session Timeout:** How long should session context persist? (Proposal: 24 hours)
2. **Location Limits:** Max sublocations per location? (Proposal: 10 for readability)
3. **Admin Permissions:** Should we track admin action attribution now? (Proposal: Yes, for audit)
4. **Export Format:** Should exports include instances or just templates? (Proposal: Separate exports)
5. **Cascade Deletes:** Confirm cascade behavior for waypoint deletion? (Proposal: Require explicit flag)
6. **Navigation Graph:** Use embedded exits in locations.json or separate navigation.json? (Proposal: Embedded for MVP, separate for complex systems)

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and approve design document
2. Create implementation tasks in project tracker
3. Begin Phase 1: Location hierarchy implementation
4. Set up test data for waypoint_28a with full location tree
5. Create example woander_store location for testing indoor navigation
