# MCP-Agent Hot Loading Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the hot loading implementation for mcp-agent in the Gaia chat service, which reduces response times from 5-10s per request to 1-3s after initialization.

## Problem

Previously, the mcp-agent framework was initialized on every request:
- Each request created a new `MCPApp` context
- Agents were created fresh for each request
- This caused 5-10s delay for every multiagent request

## Solution

Implemented singleton pattern with proper lifecycle management:

### 1. Singleton MCPApp Instance

```python
class MMOIRLMultiagentOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.app = MCPApp(name="gaia_mmoirl_multiagent")
        self._mcp_context = None
        self._agents_cache: Dict[str, List[Agent]] = {}
        self._lock = asyncio.Lock()
    
    async def initialize(self):
        """Initialize once at service startup"""
        if self._initialized:
            return
            
        # Start MCPApp context and keep it running
        self._mcp_context = self.app.run()
        await self._mcp_context.__aenter__()
        
        # Pre-create all agents
        await self._precreate_agents()
```

### 2. FastAPI Lifespan Management

```python
@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    # Startup - initialize once
    await multiagent_orchestrator.initialize()
    await hot_chat_service.initialize()
    
    yield
    
    # Shutdown - cleanup
    await multiagent_orchestrator.cleanup()
    await hot_chat_service.cleanup()
```

### 3. Pre-cached Agents

All agents are created once at startup and reused:
- Game master agents (NPCs)
- World building specialists
- Storytelling narrators
- Problem-solving experts

## Performance Results

- **First request**: 3-6s (includes one-time initialization)
- **Subsequent requests**: 1-3s (using hot-loaded agents)
- **Memory usage**: Minimal increase (~50MB for cached agents)

## Usage

The hot loading is automatic and transparent:

```python
# First request - initializes if needed
response = await multiagent_orchestrator.process_multiagent_request(
    request, auth_principal, "gamemaster"
)  # ~4s

# Second request - uses hot agents
response = await multiagent_orchestrator.process_multiagent_request(
    request, auth_principal, "gamemaster"
)  # ~1.5s
```

## Testing

Use the test script to verify hot loading:

```bash
./scripts/test-mcp-agent-hot-loading.sh https://gaia-chat-dev.fly.dev
```

Expected results:
- First multiagent request: 3-6s
- Subsequent requests: 1-3s
- Different scenarios all fast after first init
