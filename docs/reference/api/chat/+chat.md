## Chat API Documents

**[chat-endpoint-variants-explained.md](chat-endpoint-variants-explained.md)**
*   **Summary**: This document explains the rationale behind the approximately 37 chat endpoint variants in the Gaia platform. It categorizes them into groups based on their purpose, such as speed-optimized (e.g., `/chat/ultrafast`), Redis-cached, MCP-enabled, and intelligent routing, among others. The document acknowledges that the large number of routes is a form of technical debt resulting from rapid experimentation and lays out a future plan to consolidate them into a more streamlined and manageable API.
