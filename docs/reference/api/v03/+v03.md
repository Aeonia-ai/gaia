## v0.3 API Documents

**[v03-api-documentation.md](v03-api-documentation.md)**
*   **Summary**: This document details the GAIA v0.3 API, which provides a clean, simplified interface for AI chat interactions by hiding internal complexity (e.g., provider selection, model details). It covers comprehensive authentication endpoints (`/auth/login`, `/register`, etc.), chat endpoints (`/chat` for both streaming and non-streaming responses), and conversation management, all designed for ease of use and consistent formatting.

**[v03-client-specification.md](v03-client-specification.md)**
*   **Summary**: This specification defines the requirements and recommendations for implementing GAIA v0.3 API clients across various languages (e.g., TypeScript, Python). It outlines a core client interface, details authentication and request handling, covers streaming implementation with Server-Sent Events (SSE), specifies error handling types, and includes recommendations for retry logic, configuration, conversation management, and testing.
