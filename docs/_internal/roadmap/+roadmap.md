## Roadmap Documents

**[fasthtml-web-service-plan.md](fasthtml-web-service-plan.md)**
*   **Summary**: This document outlines the implementation plan for a **FastHTML Web Service**, designed to provide a server-side rendered web interface for the Gaia Platform. It details the architecture, emphasizing the use of FastHTML with HTMX for dynamic updates, routing all API calls through the existing gateway, and aiming for visual parity with the React client. The plan is phased, covering core infrastructure, authentication, chat interface, and production readiness.
