# Resume Prompt: Documentation Update for GAIA Architecture

**Objective:**
Your primary goal is to update the GAIA platform's documentation to accurately reflect the current architecture, which is centered around the `POST /experience/interact` endpoint. This involves rewriting, updating, and deprecating existing documentation as outlined in the `docs/scratchpad/documentation-update-plan.md` file.

**Current State:**
- You have analyzed the current architecture and identified the discrepancies in the existing documentation.
- You have created a detailed plan for updating the documentation, which is located at `docs/scratchpad/documentation-update-plan.md`.

**Next Steps:**
1.  **Review the Plan:** Thoroughly review the `docs/scratchpad/documentation-update-plan.md` file to re-familiarize yourself with the required changes.
2.  **Prioritize High-Priority Updates:** Begin by addressing the high-priority items listed in the plan, which involve rewriting and majorly updating critical documents like `docs/concepts/game-loop.md` and `docs/guides/adding-new-game-logic.md`.
3.  **Execute Updates:** Systematically work through the plan, updating each document as specified. Ensure all new content is accurate, clear, and consistent with the current architecture.
4.  **Verify Accuracy:** As you update the documentation, continuously verify the accuracy of your changes by referencing the source code and your understanding of the `experience/interact` endpoint.
5.  **Update Index Files:** As you update each document, ensure that the relevant `+` index files are updated to reflect the changes.
