## 📚 Historical Documentation

This section contains completed project phases, lessons learned, and deprecated documentation that provides valuable context but is no longer current.

### 📊 [Phase Reports](phase-reports/)

#### Authentication Migration (2025)
- **[Phase 3 Completion Report](phase-reports/phase3-completion-report.md)** - mTLS + JWT implementation completion
- **[mTLS Migration Plan](phase-reports/mtls-jwt-migration-plan.md)** - Original authentication modernization strategy
- **[Phase 2 Completion](phase-reports/mtls-jwt-phase2-completion.md)** - Service certificate deployment
- **[Phase 3 Implementation](phase-reports/phase3-implementation-plan.md)** - Unified authentication development

**Key Achievement:** Successfully migrated from "API key hellscape" to modern mTLS + JWT authentication while maintaining 100% backward compatibility.

### 📖 [Lessons Learned](lessons-learned.md)
**🔴 Status: ARCHIVED** - Historical development insights

Critical lessons from Gaia Platform development:
- **Authentication Complexity** - Why API key management became unsustainable
- **Deployment Challenges** - Fly.io internal DNS issues and solutions
- **Performance Optimization** - Redis caching implementation results
- **Documentation Drift** - Keeping docs aligned with implementation

### 🔄 [Authentication Lessons](authentication-lessons-learned.md)
**🔴 Status: ARCHIVED** - Authentication-specific development history

- **API Key Evolution** - From simple keys to database-first validation
- **JWT Integration** - Supabase authentication implementation challenges
- **mTLS Implementation** - Service-to-service security setup
