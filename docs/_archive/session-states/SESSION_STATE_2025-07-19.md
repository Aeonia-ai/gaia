# Session State - July 19, 2025

## Current Status: mTLS + JWT Migration Phase 2

### Session Context
- **Previous Issue**: Fixed Supabase email verification and deployment issues
- **Current Focus**: Migrating from legacy API key authentication to mTLS + JWT
- **User Sentiment**: "this hellscape" (referring to API key management) - wants modern auth
- **Shell Issue**: Claude Code experiencing shell environment error preventing bash commands

### Completed Work

#### Phase 1 ‚úÖ
1. Created comprehensive migration plan (`docs/mtls-jwt-migration-plan.md`)
2. Implemented JWT service (`app/shared/jwt_service.py`)
3. Added service token generation endpoint (`/internal/service-token`)
4. Updated auth validation to accept both API keys and JWTs
5. Created and tested JWT authentication script (`scripts/test-jwt-auth.sh`)

#### Phase 2 (Infrastructure Complete, Testing Pending)
1. **Certificate Generation** ‚úÖ
   - Created `scripts/setup-dev-ca.sh` 
   - Generated CA, service certificates, and JWT signing keys
   - All certificates in `certs/` directory

2. **mTLS Client Module** ‚úÖ
   - Created `app/shared/mtls_client.py`
   - Supports both mTLS and JWT authentication
   - Factory functions for service clients

3. **Docker Compose Updates** ‚úÖ
   - Updated all services to mount certificates
   - Fixed certificate paths (mounting full `/certs` directory)
   - Added environment variables for TLS and JWT paths

4. **Testing** ‚ö†Ô∏è PENDING
   - Created `scripts/test-mtls-connections.py` 
   - Created `test-phase2-commands.md` with manual test commands
   - Tests not run due to shell environment issue

### Current Todo List
1. ‚úÖ Phase 1: JWT service-to-service token generation
2. ‚úÖ Phase 1: Update validate_auth_for_service to accept JWTs  
3. ‚úÖ Phase 1: Create certificate infrastructure scripts
4. ‚úÖ Phase 1: Test JWT auth alongside API_KEY auth
5. ‚úÖ Phase 2: Generate mTLS certificates for all services
6. ‚úÖ Phase 2: Create mTLS client module
7. ‚úÖ Phase 2: Update docker compose for certificate mounting
8. ‚ö†Ô∏è Phase 2: Test mTLS connections between services **<-- CURRENT**
9. üîú Phase 3: Migrate web and mobile clients to Supabase JWTs
10. üîú Phase 3: Update gateway to validate Supabase JWTs
11. üîú Phase 3: Implement token refresh mechanisms
12. üîú Phase 4: Remove legacy API_KEY validation logic
13. üîú Phase 4: Update documentation and client SDKs
14. üîú Phase 4: Perform security audit

### Shell Environment Issue
```
Error: zsh:source:1: no such file or directory: /var/folders/.../claude-shell-snapshot-2914
```
This prevents running bash commands but doesn't affect file operations or Python tools.

### Next Actions Required
1. **Run Phase 2 Tests**:
   ```bash
   python3 ./scripts/test-mtls-connections.py
   ```

2. **Manual Testing** (if automated test fails):
   - Follow commands in `test-phase2-commands.md`
   - Test JWT generation and validation
   - Check service logs for certificate loading

3. **Once Tests Pass**:
   - Mark Phase 2 as complete
   - Begin Phase 3: Client migration to Supabase JWTs

### Key Files Created This Session
- `/docs/mtls-jwt-migration-plan.md` - Complete migration strategy
- `/app/shared/jwt_service.py` - JWT token service
- `/app/shared/mtls_client.py` - mTLS HTTP client
- `/scripts/setup-dev-ca.sh` - Certificate generation script
- `/scripts/test-jwt-auth.sh` - JWT testing script
- `/scripts/test-mtls-connections.py` - Phase 2 test suite
- `/docs/mtls-jwt-phase2-completion.md` - Phase 2 status report
- `/test-phase2-commands.md` - Manual test commands

### Services Status
All services are running with certificates mounted:
- ‚úÖ Gateway (port 8666)
- ‚úÖ Auth Service
- ‚úÖ Asset Service  
- ‚úÖ Chat Service
- ‚úÖ Web Service (port 8080)
- ‚úÖ Database, NATS, Redis

### Critical Information
- **API Key**: `FJUeDkZRy0uPp7cYtavMsIfwi7weF9-RT7BeOlusqnE` (for testing)
- **JWT Issuer**: "gaia-platform"
- **JWT Audience**: "gaia-services"
- **Certificate Validity**: 365 days from generation
- **Docker Compose**: Uses space (`docker compose`) not hyphen

### Resume Instructions
1. Check if shell commands work: `ls`
2. If shell works: Run `python3 ./scripts/test-mtls-connections.py`
3. If shell doesn't work: Follow manual test commands in `test-phase2-commands.md`
4. Review test results and proceed to Phase 3 if all pass
