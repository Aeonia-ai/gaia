# Session State - July 19, 2025 (Final)

## üéØ Mission Accomplished: mTLS + JWT Migration

### Starting Point
- User frustrated with "hellscape" of API key management
- Goal: Migrate to modern authentication (mTLS + JWT)
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition

### Completed Work Summary

#### ‚úÖ Phase 1: JWT Service Implementation
1. Created JWT service (`app/shared/jwt_service.py`)
2. Added service token generation endpoint
3. Updated auth validation to accept JWTs
4. Created JWT testing scripts
5. Tested alongside API key auth

#### ‚úÖ Phase 2: mTLS Infrastructure
1. Generated all certificates (CA, service certs, JWT keys)
2. Created mTLS client module (`app/shared/mtls_client.py`)
3. Updated Docker Compose with certificate mounts
4. Fixed JWT key path issues
5. Verified JWT generation works

#### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Client Migration Support
1. Created unified authentication function
2. Updated gateway to accept both API keys and Supabase JWTs
3. Modified web service to use JWTs when available
4. Maintained full backward compatibility
5. Enabled gradual migration path

### Current State
- **API Keys**: Still working (unchanged)
- **Service JWTs**: Working for service-to-service auth
- **Supabase JWTs**: Ready for web/mobile clients
- **Migration Path**: Dual auth enabled, zero breaking changes

### Key Files Created/Modified
```
Created:
- /docs/mtls-jwt-migration-plan.md
- /app/shared/jwt_service.py
- /app/shared/mtls_client.py
- /scripts/setup-dev-ca.sh
- /scripts/test-jwt-auth.sh
- /scripts/test-mtls-connections.py
- /docs/phase3-implementation-plan.md
- /docs/phase3-completion-report.md

Modified:
- /app/shared/security.py (added get_current_auth_unified)
- /app/gateway/main.py (updated endpoints to unified auth)
- /app/services/web/utils/gateway_client.py (JWT support)
- /docker compose.yml (certificate mounts)
```

### Testing Results
- ‚úÖ API key authentication: Working
- ‚úÖ JWT token generation: Working
- ‚úÖ Certificate infrastructure: Complete
- ‚úÖ Unified authentication: Implemented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Full Supabase JWT flow: Needs real login test

### Next Steps (Phase 3 Remaining)
- [ ] Implement token refresh mechanisms
- [ ] Test with real Supabase login flow

### Future Work (Phase 4)
- [ ] Remove legacy API key logic (after full migration)
- [ ] Update documentation and SDKs
- [ ] Security audit

### Success Metrics
- Zero breaking changes ‚úÖ
- Gradual migration enabled ‚úÖ
- Both auth methods working ‚úÖ
- "Hellscape" has an exit path ‚úÖ

### Environment Status
- All services running
- Certificates properly mounted
- Gateway accepting dual authentication
- Web UI ready for JWT usage

### Final Note
The authentication migration infrastructure is complete and operational. Users can continue using API keys while gradually transitioning to JWTs. The web UI will automatically use JWTs after Supabase login, and all other clients can migrate at their own pace.
