## üöÄ MMOIRL Deployment Architecture: Cluster-Per-Game (Recommended)

### Strategic Decision: Ship Games Now, Optimize Later
**Cluster-per-game** is the chosen architecture for MMOIRL, prioritizing speed to market and operational simplicity.

### Why This Approach
- **Launch in weeks, not months** - No multi-tenancy development overhead
- **Prove the concept** - Validate MMOIRL before optimizing infrastructure  
- **Learn from real games** - Discover actual patterns from player behavior
- **Maintain focus** - Build games, not infrastructure complexity
- **Reduce risk** - Bugs in one game can't affect others

### Key Advantages
1. **Complete Isolation**: Each game operates independently
2. **Maximum Customization**: Unique AI behaviors, tools, and features per game
3. **Simple Operations**: Restart, debug, or update one game at a time
4. **Clean Architecture**: No tenant filtering in queries or caching
5. **Fast Development**: Ship first game in 2-3 weeks

### Deployment Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: First game on Docker Compose
- **Week 3-4**: Deploy to Fly.io (`gaia-zombies-chat`, etc.)
- **Month 2**: Launch 2-3 more games
- **Month 3+**: Scale successful games to Kubernetes
- **Year 2**: Consider multi-tenancy if you have 50+ games

### Real Launch Examples
1. **"Zombie Survival MMOIRL"** (Week 1)
   - Weather API affects zombie behavior
   - Location-based safe houses
   - News events trigger hordes

2. **"Fantasy Quest AR"** (Week 3)
   - Image recognition for spell components
   - Social sharing of discoveries
   - Collaborative boss battles

3. **"Fitness Warriors"** (Week 5)
   - Health app integration
   - Competitive daily challenges
   - Real-time coaching AI

### Future-Proof Design
The architecture supports easy migration to multi-tenancy later, but **you won't need it until you have 20-50+ successful games**. Focus on shipping games first.

See [MMOIRL Cluster Architecture](mmoirl-cluster-architecture.md) for detailed deployment instructions.
